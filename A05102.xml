         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For ſeeing the knowledge of God, tending to his ſeruice, is the principall outte of our being and of all our actions: and that his infinite eſſence cannot make it ſelfe to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended woorthily, and according to his greatnes by the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mans vnderſtanding: it behooueth vs carefully to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon his workes, for ſo much as in them the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect

Now we conſider of the worke of God principally in two things (yea, and to them we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer all the diſcourſe concerning this matter:) to wit, in the creation conducting, and gouernment of his creatures; and in the myſterie of Redemption, which it hath pleaſed him to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe on mankinde.

                  <p>The beginning of euerie thing whatſoeuer, is of ſuch waight and importance, that on the knowledge of the ſame dependeth all the ſcience thereof: for it is impoſſible that a man can be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in any thing, if he be ignorant in the principles, and firſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſubiect which he deſireth to know: contrariwiſe hauing well knowne them, the vnderſtanding of the effects which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enſue, of the vertues and qualities which thereby redound, of the actions which therof proceed, of the degrees which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are eſtabliſhed, of the bounds and limits whereto theſe firſt cauſes tend to obtaine their perfection, declareth it ſelfe, as of it owne accord, without great difficultie and much paine.

But <hi>Plato</hi> followed of a great number of the moſt cleere-ſighted wiſemen, hath confeſſed the generation of the world which he teacheth to be ordered, and diſpoſed by compleat and perfect numbers: vnder the vaile of which, &amp; the obſcure notes of hidden ſenſe, it ſeemeth that he would hide the cloſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the creation of the vniuers to thoſe which were not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in ſuch ſecrets, which onely may be comprehended by a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8737:11"/>
pure and celeſtiall cogitation diuinely infuſed. For let vs know that there is no certaintie at all of this doctrine, except for thoſe to whom the minde, by a ſpecial and ſupernaturall grace is ſharp, being faſhioned and formed by meditation of the immutable ſubſtance of God himſelfe, and by a ſecret operation of the holy Ghoſt, to beleeue that it is the Eternall who by his word hath made all nature. For ſo the Soueraigne Creator talketh with man, and eſtabliſheth a certaine teſtimonie of his truth in the heart of him, when he hath made him proper and meet to heare him, with the beſt and moſt excellent part of his vnderſtanding, in regard whereof he is ſaid to be made according to his owne image.</p>
                  <p>But although theſe things may be knowne, being nor far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from our interiour,<note place="margin">How the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world may be belieued.</note> or exteriour ſenſes, yea ſo that they may be called preſent, and whereof no doubt is to bee made, eſpecially being ſupported by authoritie of good witneſſes; yet thoſe things which ſurpaſſe the ordinarie puiſſance of the minde, becauſe by our owne iudgement we cannot credit them, muſt be conſidered, and beleeued, according to that couenant of veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they announce vnto vs, who haue known the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by our vnderſtanding peaceful, and duely purged: ſo that we may adde faith to ſuch holy perſonages, as God hath made capable of his light, and which inſtruct vs not in the things which they haue imagined, but in ſuch as they haue heard &amp; receiued from diuine oracles. It is then of their authoritie, that he muſt make a buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kler, whoſoeuer will meetly debate of God, and of his workes, and of his prouidence in the gouernance of them. And when the wings of Nature faile vs in ſo loftie a contemplation, we muſt take to vs thoſe of diuine grace; and when the naturall light fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and is readie to die, to require an infuſed and ſupernaturall illumination. The world is greateſt of all things viſible, and God of all things inuiſible. That the world is, we perceiue; but that God is, we beleeue. Now that he hath made the world, we can better beleeue of no bodie then of God himſelfe. But where haue we heard that? In his word, whereto we muſt giue credit concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe things whereof it is expedient that we ſhould not be ignorant, and which we of our ſelues are not able to vnderſtand. Now he hath ſpoken firſt by his prophets, then by himſelfe in the perſon of our Redeemer, and laſtly by the Apoſtles and diſciples. We heare him ſpeaking aloude, where <hi>Moſes</hi> the father of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,<note place="margin">

And the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who alwaies behold the face of their father, ſpeake to them alſo, and announce the ſecrets of the eternal Maieſtie, to all them (I ſay) in ſuch ſort as it pleaſeth the Omnipotent to make them worthie. One of theſe was <hi>Moſes,</hi> who teacheth vs that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie made this great Vniuers. A witneſſe ſo excellent and worthy, that by him we muſt belieue in God, whom we perceiue, as it were through the ſame wiſedome and ſpirit, which reuealed vnto him the creation of the world: who prophecied almoſt two thouſand yeeres before of the high-myſteries of Chriſtian faith: confirming alſo his whole doctrine, by miracles, prodigies, ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and prophecies, wherewith all his writings abound. And therefore hauing confidence in his teſtimonie, we call God, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things, thereby inferring, that he is author, principall, and firſt cauſe of all eſſences, which cauſe by manner of ſpeech ought to be <hi>full of all</hi> things, if this Maxime of the Peripatetickes be true. (That none can giue away of that which he hath not.) And therefore the Poet the honor of our age very learnedly ſaith.

and by an <hi>alone vnique action neuer disturbed,</hi> his linage full of vnderſtanding, the very image of the father, his worde, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect patterne of the worlde, and his loue and power the holie Ghoſt, which allieth the vnderſtanding with the thought, three perſons in one eſſence and ſubſtance. Afterward this Godhead, though in it ſelfe it was ſoueraigne good, not hauing neede of any ſtrange thing, yet woulde he according to his owne bountie in him conſiſting, produce the outward worke of the worlde, whereinto ſpreading himſelfe, by a kinde of proceſſe of well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered degrees, and diſpoſing through admirable workmanſhip the harmonicall formes of the heauens: the angels and men by him created to be made partakers of felicitie, contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe maruailes, were rauiſhed and carried away with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of ſpirituall things, and by the beautie of his workes, and ornament of his creatures haue learned to acknowledge the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Vniuers.

Of this prohibition doth S. <hi>Hierome</hi> make mention. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon Geneſis, ſearching out the deepe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets hidden vnder the vaile of ſimple words therein contained, ſpeaketh to the Reader in this manner. [Comprehend this if thou canſt; if not not, leaue it to them, which are more learned.

For it ſpeaketh in ſuch ſort, that in height it ſcorneth the proude, in depth it aſtoniſheth thoſe which are attentiue to it. It feedeth the great with truth, and nouriſheth the ſmall ones with milde and familiar diſcourſe.] And in truth in each part of <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, the treaſures of all Philoſophie are by him diſcouered, like as if they were cloſely hidden in ſome field, chiefly in this place which we haue intended to entreat of tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the creation. For of deliberate purpoſe he argueth in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie of the originall of all things, of God, of the degree, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and order of the parts of this great world.

                  <p>But before we proceed to conſider of the precious treaſures, and learned doctrine wherewith the ſacred ſayings of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet touching the creation are repleniſhed: it will be good that we diſcourſe a little of the principall arguments, whereupon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, better Philoſophers then good Chriſtians, haue obiected againſt this doctrine of framing of the world. And I will willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begin with this old queſtion of the Epicure,<note place="margin">Why God made the world in the time that Moſes declareth.</note> which the atheiſts of our time haue renewed, to wit: Why in the time that <hi>Moſes</hi> recordeth, it pleaſed the eternal God to create heauen and earth,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8737:13"/>
which he had not made before? If they, which ſay thus, woulde thereby inferre, that the worlde hath beene eternall without any beginning, and for that cauſe it ſeemeth to them that God made it not, they are too farre wide of the truth, and ſicke of the mortall diſeaſe of impietie. For beſides the manifold tellings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall teſtimonies, which make the creation of heauen and earth vndoubtable: euen the world it ſelfe, by his motion, and well ordered changing, &amp; the gorgeous ſhew of all things viſible therein contained, not ſpeaking one word, do after a ſort cry out, that it was made, &amp; that it could be no otherwiſe formed, then by God, who is ineffablie, &amp; inuiſibly glorious. For it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that a thing of moſt exquiſite order &amp; reaſon, ſhould haue bin made by chance; &amp; that a deed moſt ſoueraigne, could haue any other father then ſoueraigne; nor ſo goodly a worke anie other architect then one eſſentially, goodly. And therefore all the ſchooles of thoſe Philoſophers, which haue had any whit of diuine ſenſe, affirme with one conſent, that there is nothing which more prooueth that God hath made the world, and that it is gouerned by his care &amp; prouidence, then the only beholding of the whole world, and conſideration of the beautie and order thereof. But ſee heere what imagination not grounded on ſenſe putteth into the mouthes of many. What did God (ſay they) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he created the world? why ſtaide he till then? or why ſtaide he not a little longer? In theſe and ſuch like doubts they inwrap themſelues; making no difference betweene the condition of God, and our owne; betweene his eternall eſſence, and that of thoſe things, which haue once had a beginning. But with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreete, and pleaſant anſwere Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reſolueth thoſe, which demaunde what God did before the fabrication of the world. He was buſie (ſaith he) cutting downe wood in the forreſt, to burne the raſh and curious, who remember not what they themſelues did yeſterday, and yet dare inquire what God hath done of eternitie. But that I may ſpeake to the moſt ſubtile, let the beſt learned among them tell me, what they intend by this worde (before) whereof they inquire?<note place="margin">Time began with the world.</note> If they meane the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away oftime, they deceiue themſelues, becauſe time tooke beginning with the world. And if by the worde they imagine ſomething concerning eternitie, they abuſe themſelues alſo, for therein is neither before, nor after. For eternitie is an entire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at once altogither, without any proceeding. Whereby it is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8737:13"/>
euident that their queſtion is nothing. Time therefore cannot accord with eternitie, nor be eternall, ſeeing eternall hath no proceſſe. It is therefore a fooliſh queſtion, why before time was, God created not the temporall world, as if there had beene ſome ſucceeding ſeaſons, before any ſucceſſion did conſiſt: for one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any reaſon imagine any time before the ſtabliſhing of the vniuers. Yet <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whom the atheiſts will rather beleeue then the word of truth, prooueth no other thing, when he enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himſelfe to declare the eternitie of the world, then that time was neuer without the world, nor the world without time, which the Sages ſay, march in equall pace with the place. Wherefore as there is nothing beſide place, appertaining to place; ſo there is nothing beſide time, belonging to time. And for thoſe which aske why the creator made not his world later: I againe requeſt them that ſetting apart the worke of the vniuers, they would aſſigne me their before, &amp; after, &amp; then I will render them a reaſon why God created not the world ſooner, or later: It is moſt certaine that they ſhall be conſtrained to confeſſe, that before the order &amp; entercourſe of the Spheres, there was neuer any before or after, which are the conditions of time. And therefore their raſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund deſerueth no other anſwere, except we recount vnto them the pleaſant ſaying of <hi>Democritus,</hi> which is not vnfit for our purpoſe in this place <hi>(No man regards that which is before his feete, and yet we ſee many ſound the ſecrets of heauen, and curiouſly ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the myſteries of God.)</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of thoſe which take from the world the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of time.</note> There are others alſo who diſputing more ſubtilly of theſe matters, agree verie well that the world was made, but they will not allow that it had a beginning of time, but of his owne creation, ſo that it hath alwaies had a being in ſome ſort, which they cannot vnderſtand. Thoſe found their opinion vpon this pretext to defend that God ſhould not do any action new, or of chaunce, for feare leaſt men ſhould beleeue, that that came ſuddenly into his minde, which before he had not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to make the world, and that he, who is immutable in all things, ſhould create it, through a new-ſprong thought. Now as they make doubt, concerning the time, which they would not haue begun with the vniuers: let me aske them alſo, why the world was ſet in that place where it reſteth, rather then any other where? For if they ſuppoſe infinite ſpaces of time, before the generation of the vniuers, in which it ſeemeth not that God could reſt from worke: they may aſwell beleeue many ſpaces of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8737:14"/>
place out of the world: wherein if any could affirme that the Omnipotent hath not been idle, they ſhould be forced to dreame with the Epicure of innumerable worlds. But if they anſwere me that the thoughts of men are vaine, by which they ſuppoſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite places, ſith there is no place out of the world: I may tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, that they are ill-grounded in the conſideration of time, ſith there was neuer any before the world. And therefore as it is no conſequence, that God framed the vniuers, rather by aduenture, then by diuine reaſon; not in any other place, but in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is; though mans capacitie cannot compriſe the ſame diuine reaſon, by which, it was ſo made: So is it no conſequence, that we ſhould denie that it happened to God by chaunce, or by a new imagination, when he created the world, rather in one certaine time, then before, ſeeing that the times precedent how long-ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we may imagine them, ſhould be equally paſt away, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them with eternitie, by an infinite ſpace at once: and there ſhould be no difference why an auncient time ſhould be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, before a latter. Wherefore we muſt all beleeue, that the world was made with the time, and that time tooke beginning with the world,<note place="margin">Of the will of God in the worke of the Creation.</note> and that notwithſtanding, in making it, God chaunged not his eternall counſell, nor his immutable will: but according to his inſcrutable prouidence and bountie innate, he would, when he pleaſed, compoſe the large frame of the vniuers, full of his image. And here the definition which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of <hi>Time,</hi> ſerueth to our purpoſe, to wit, that it is the meaſure of motion. For if immutable eternitie is eaſily diſcerned from <hi>Time,</hi> who perceiueth not, that time had neuer beene, if ſome creature had not beene made, who might chaunge the created ſpecies by moouing? For that which giueth time his courſe, is the chaunging of things, when they giue place one to another, and one ſucceed another, becauſe they cannot conſiſt all at once to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Let vs conclude (therefore) ſeeing that the holy and moſt true writings expreſſe (that: <hi>In the beginning God created heauen and earth</hi>) we may aſſure our ſelues there was nothing before then, and that doubtleſſe the world was not made in time but with it. For that which is done in time, is done both before, and after ſome time: after (I ſay) that which is paſt, and before that which is to come. Now before the world, there was no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the chaungeable motion of which, time might haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Wherefore the world and time haue the ſame begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8737:14"/>
by the will of almightie God, and according as is declared vnto vs in his word: againſt which, there is no other reaſon of <hi>Sophiſts,</hi> which can conclude any reaſonable apparance, as you ARAM may amply declare, in the proceſſe of our diſcourſe.</p>

For if it had had any cauſe, then muſt that cauſe haue preceded, and the will of God attended thereupon, which were vnlawfull to be imagined.

Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe haue we ſufficient in his word wherewith to ſatisfie our mindes, in meditation of his ſecrets with all reuerence.

But the way of truth is ſhut vp to the wiſe of the world, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained but by the directions of it ſelfe. So that (which is greatly to be deplored) it often commeth to paſſe, which this Iambicke relateth, <hi>(That the vnderstanding of things giuen by God, in long tract of time, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded by mens opinions, retaining very little diuinitie, &amp; truth, by reaſon that it agreeth not with thoſe things, which fall within the compaſſe of our ſenſe.)</hi> The philoſophers therefore, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing too much faith to themſelues, haue blinded themſelues through their vaine diſcourſes, and haue become guides to the blinde: ſo that falling into the ditch, they haue drawne many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, by falſe arguments, and apparant reaſons, whereof our ſubiect ſhall here be to inſert the moſt principall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:8737:15"/>They then, who eſteeme that nothing is ſtable, or can be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in ſuch ſort reaſoning, and arguing by ſenſible things, prooue it by the ſame demonſtration that <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath deliuered,<note place="margin">Of the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</note> yea and as he hath obſerued in his whole diſcourſe, &amp; natural progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (conſidering that all his conſequences proceede from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine maximes, which he ſuppoſed to be perfect true) &amp; amongſt the moſt powerfull inuentions, by which they pretend to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the creation, and framing of the world, theſe Peripateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reaſons of the nature of the world are produced. Firſt, they beholde the heauens altogither differing from contrarietie:<note place="margin">Reaſons of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers againſt the creation of the world.</note> whereupon they conclude, that it is not corruptible, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not made. They finde moreouer, that thoſe things which haue a beginning, doe get vnto themſelues a new place: nowe heauen not being able to get it ſelfe a new place, they conclude that it could not be created at any time. They conſider alſo that all things which are mooued, paſſe into a new place, or are moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued round about ſome thing, which remaineth firme (as all the ſpheres are about their center) to the end that all diſorder might be brought to ſome vniformitie. Likewiſe they ſuppoſe euery new thing to be reduced into the old: ſo that all generation and corruption is made according to the old ſubſtance, and all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is gouerned by the firme and ſtable earth, or the vnmooueable center, by which principles they coulde not perceiue how the newnes of the world could any way come to paſſe. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the generation of one thing is the corruption of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that nothing which ſhould be corrupted might precede the world, thereupon they ground that it is eternall without a beginning. Proceeding farther, they ſuppoſe that euerie thing which is produced, had a fore-being in the matter thereof. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (they holde) that of neceſſitie the matter muſt be eternall. But the moſt principall and ſubſtantiall argument, which they bring, and moſt generally receiued, is, That of nothing, nothing is created; whereupon they conclude, that the world could not be made, bicauſe nothing did proceede it.</p>
                  <p>Now we may eaſily anſwere theſe reaſons, and trie whether they conclude,<note place="margin">Three ſorts of works, and three kinds of workers.</note> or not: but firſt let vs ſuppoſe (as it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) that there be three ſorts of works, and three kindes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. For there is the Artificer, who preſuppoſeth the nature, to wit, the ſtuffe, faſhion, and all the compound. There is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall agent, which requireth before-hand; the effect of God, to wit,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8737:15"/>
the ſubiect, or the matter. And there is God the ſoueraigne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who hath no neede of any other thing, becauſe he is perfect, retaining in himſelfe all manner of vertue. Which three kindes of workers doe fitly accord by a certaine analogie and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but doe much differ in compariſon one with the other: and at the bounds and limits of the one worker, cannot be concluded the power of the other. For it were an error to proceed from arte to nature, as if one ſhould ſay: The arte doth firſt require the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, the Goldſmith gold, the Founder mettall, the Carpenter wood, and the Maſon ſtones and cement: therefore the naturall agent doth alſo require the compound.<note place="margin">Anſwere to the arguments of philoſophers.</note> And likewiſe the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers deceiue themſelues, when they imagine that the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Creator hath neede of a ſubiect, or matter to worke on, as is requiſite for the naturall agent. Alſo they abuſe themſelues to teach, that foraſmuch as herein there paſſeth a certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion from one contrarie to another, it therefore followeth, that God and nature doe proceede by one and the ſelfe-ſame way. But where (I pray) haue they learned to inuent ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, when themſelues teach, that arte is diſtinguiſhed from nature, and that naturall things appertaine to one kinde of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and the eternall, and free-from-motion belong to another? For the artificer giueth the artificiall forme, and requireth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; and the naturall agent faſhioneth the ſubſtantiall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the materiall, which is the worke of the ſoueraigne. But if God ſhould require any thing before-hand to worke with, he ſhould alſo require a former God which muſt haue produced it, and by that reaſon there ſhould be I wot not what former thing before the firſt. What are then theſe ſhewes of arguments? They conclude and accord badly, when bicauſe of the paſſion of a new place, which demaundeth that which is newly performed, they would thereby exclude the world from generation, bicauſe it getteth not a place. But what abſurditie ſhall they finde it, if granting them that it hath obtained a place; I ſay it is the ſame wherein at this preſent it remaineth? For it ſubſiſteth about the center, or aboue that of the earth, or of the whole vniuers, or of the ſphere intellectuall, whoſe center (as <hi>Hermes</hi> ſaith) is all that which is euerie where created. In that which they farther inferre, that euery new thing muſt be reduced to an olde, we grant it them. But that olde, is the diuine cogitation, wherein all things are contained, before they be diſplaied in their proper formes:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8737:16"/>
which, being created by it ſelfe, it alone doth gouerne and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them afterwardes. What they moreouer adioine, that all naturall tranſmutation is made of one matter tranſpoſed into another, we conſent to them. But this is not requiſite in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue production, free from all lawes of nature, whereto by right the prince thereof is not obliged. And we agree alſo that euery thing, which is produced, muſt firſt be included in ſome other power, before it be effected: but we ſay that naturall things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained firſt in the matter; and the world and diuerſitie of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, were compriſed in the Ideas, or exemplaries reſident euerlaſtingly in God. And ſo doe the Platoniſts maintaine, who mounting much higher then the Peripateticks, agree with that which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>That all things were made by the word, and that in it was life:</hi> which brought foorth all things, and that in it the world before was by power compriſed. Wherefore theſe be no dreames (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth them) but the Ideas of <hi>Plato:</hi> but thoſe are ſighted like the bat, who ſee not the things moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in nature, thereby to acknowledge the author of nature. And to the end that we looſen the ſtrongeſt knot of their arguments, to wit,<note place="margin">Nullitie of the argument, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of nothing can be made.</note> 
                     <hi>That of nothing nothing is created:</hi> I would deſire them to expound me their ſentence, bicauſe it is doubtfull, and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: for if the ſenſe be thus, that of nothing, by arte, or nature nothing is made, bicauſe they require the matter whereupon to worke: we willingly accord. But what is this to purpoſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſupreme and almightie architect, whom nature doth follow after, as farre as arte doth nature, as all philoſophers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: For according as the naturall agent, bounded and ſubiect to motion, time, and ſucceſſion, is leſſe and more diſable in eſſence; ſo is it leſſe in performance then he, who is free, and at libertie from all lawes of nature. But if they meane, that of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (to wit) after it hath no being, nothing is created; then haue they left it to this preſent to diſcuſſe, and to all poſteritie for euer. Wherefore we haue a ſpacious field, to denie them that which is neither prooued, nor euident in it ſelfe. If they inferre, that this nothing reiecteth all manner of cauſes: then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them in this point. But in the creation, or generation of the world, we preſuppoſe (as truth requireth) a working, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne cauſe, who in the infinite vertue of it ſelfe, containeth the matter, ſubiect and faſhion, to beſtow the meanes, the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing qualities, and all that, which is requiſite to reduce, and bring
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8737:16"/>
to perfection any buſines. Behold then, how all theſe arguments conclude nothing againſt the doctrine of the worlds creation, no more theſe other reaſons deriued from the motions, and their bounds, which the Peripateticks doe farther induce againſt the ſame, as purſuing this matter (ACHITOB) we may heare of you.</p>

                  <p>THE Peripateticks, whereof now adaies manie may be found, perſeuering in their naturall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,<note place="margin">Nullitie of the argument of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in reſpect of the diuine peece of worke.</note> and conſidering that motion conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in that which is mooued, or ingendred, or elſe in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of tranſmutation, and becauſe no ſubſtance did precede the primitiue production of the world, thereupon they conclude, that it was neuer created. But it is no maruell if they be greatly abuſed, ſeeing they would neuer ſwarue from their ſenſe, and ſenſible things: whereof no pure and ſincere truth can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe that by them, or by the reaſons on them founded, we cannot attaine to the knowledge of diuine myſteries, which are intellectuall, farre remote from any ſubſtance, moouing, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or other ſenſiblenes. And therefore they much deceiue themſelues, when they, in ſuch ſort, argue of theſe groſſe, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial generations, comparing them with the diuine maſter peece of worke, which ſurpaſſeth all meanes of nature. They maintaine that all direct (or forward) motion cannot be perpetuall, becauſe it requireth infinit ſpace which nature is not able to endure: but circular motion, becauſe it paſſeth nothing infinit, may be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. Now in eternall things, the conſequence is good from the power to the being. One may then (ſay they) thereby aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the eternitie of the world. But ſee a goodly reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe that to be perpetuall and infinite, which they pretend to prooue. <hi>Auerrois</hi> proceedeth farther, and ſaith, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the world to haue had any other diſpoſition, then ſuch as at this preſent it hath, and that being exempt from all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie, it followeth, that in no wiſe it is corruptible, and therefore
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8737:17"/>
was not engendred. But who reuealed vnto him that which he ſuppoſeth of the ſtate of the world? With what meaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth he to meat out the puiſſance of the ſoueraigne worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?<note place="margin">Other vaine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</note> By what authoritie dares he limite out the power of the infinite, ſo, that hee may not deſtroy, and builde vp at his good pleaſure? I ſay then that the paſſing away of heauen hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of bound and limit, then the earth, and the very reſt it ſelfe, whereto (as with one minde all Philoſophers teach) all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth tend.<note place="margin">All motion tends to a reſt.</note> But foraſmuch as motion begetteth time, and time it ſelfe is the meaſure of motion, thereby it commeth, that forging their arguments vpon one part of time, they miſſe and faile in reaſon, when they diſpute thus: If the world was not before it tooke beginning, ſeeing this (before) is an appendix of time; then it followeth that time ſhoulde precede motion, which is his cauſe, and progenitor. Again they ſay [In euery inſtant and moment aſſigned, is the beginning of time to come, and the end of time paſt: then time hath beene before this firſt inſtant, and conſequently motion, and the world.] But the cauſe of theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors proceedeth from the miſunderſtanding of words, when they woulde barre that this worde (before) ſhould ſignifie any thing elſe then ſome part of time. For as well in the diuine as prophane writings of all authors, who can ſpeake fitly and properly, we may finde that this particle (before) ſignifieth more then a part of time, for ſometimes it denoteth the extreme: as is ſaid in the Prouerbes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.</note> [The Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way before he created any thing, I haue had principalitie from euerlaſting,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 24.12.</note> and before the earth.] And in Eccleſiaſticus, [He created me from the beginning, and before the world.] <hi>Ouid</hi> himſelfe in his Metamorphoſis vſeth this manner of ſpeech, [Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſea, the earth, and heauen which couereth all things,] though that being of a fine, and ſubtile ſpirite, he was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that time ſlideth away by reaſon of the turning of heauen. Moreouer this worde <hi>(Ante)</hi> ſignifieth amongſt the Latins, the higheſt degree, whereof is deriued <hi>(Antistes)</hi> he which is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, and cheefe among others. Sith therefore this particle (before) hath diuers ſignifications, why will our Peripateticks reſtraine it to denote any other thing, but onely a portion of time. Would they not grant me this, that by a certaine order the matter was before the forme, and yet preceded it not in time? So is it that God was before the world, by a certaine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8737:17"/>
of eternitie. What they farther inferre [That the inſtant is the end of time paſt, and the beginning of time to come:<note place="margin">Of the point as inſtant.</note>] We anſwere them, that as the point is to things continued, ſo is the inſtant to things ſucceeding. Now the point is ſometime the extreme of one part of a line, and the beginning of another part: and ſometimes alſo it is the beginning of the whole line, and not the end of any part precedent. So the inſtant and moment wherein the world had being, was the beginning of the time to enſue, and not the end of any paſt. They adde another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt this doctrine, [That (ſay they) which paſſeth on hath ſomething both before, and after it] But Ile proceede far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and grant them more, to wit, that all that which paſſeth on returneth to the ſame point, from whence it began to paſſe. For the water returneth to the ſea from whence it had an originall. The bodie returneth to the earth from whence it was borrowed. The ſoule,<note place="margin">Al things returne to God.</note> and other intellectuall things created of God (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which the Scripture teacheth vs of the reprobate) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to himſelfe, of whom they were engendred. And all eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces produced from the diuine thought, make a full circle begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in God, and finiſhing in God himſelfe. So muſt time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into the ſame eternitie, whereout it proceeded, and which ſhall remaine (this ſame ceaſing) in ſuch ſort as it conſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. And therefore we anſwere thoſe who demaund how the creator coulde precede the fabrication of the world, that hee proceeded it by an eternall enduring. Wherefore they conclude iuſt nothing againſt the Creation of that which then was, and is after the generation of things. Others which reaſon vpon the point, which we haue deliuered concerning the opinion of <hi>Auerrois,</hi> that the world is not corruptible, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not engendred, argue thus. [That which is diſſolued into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, is diuided: but conſidering that beſide the world, there is nothing, into which it can be diſſolued, it muſt therefore endure euerlaſtingly.] To which we may anſwere them,<note place="margin">How the world is diſſolued.</note> that the world is diſſolued according to his parts, to the ende that it may remaine in a better eſtate. But now we diſpute not of the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, but onely of the originall thereof. And it may ſeeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrarie to Chriſtian religion, that the worke of God may alwaies haue a being: but farre otherwiſe then as we ſee it, and which ſhall be then, when we, moſt bleſſed, ſhall inhabite the new heauens and new earth, in life euerlaſting. And herein doe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8737:18"/>
we concurre with ſundrie great Philoſophers, who eſteeme, that it is ill done to ſuppoſe, that thoſe things which immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the bleſſed God, can periſh. And therefore we affirme that the ſoule is immortall, becauſe it was produced, and inſpired by God: and that the bodie it ſelfe ſhall obtaine eternitie, when afterwards in the reſurrection it ſhall be reueſted with the nature of the ſoule: which ſubiect we haue amply diſcourſed vpon in the ſecond part of our Academie. But it is ill-concluded, to take away all beginning from things, by reaſon of the perpetuall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of the ſame.<note place="margin">The opinion of diuers, is that the celeſtiall ſpirits moo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſith we are in this talke of the enduring of the world, we may further note, that thoſe, who haue thereupon imagined to take away the originall thereof, haue taught, that the ſpirits moouing the ſpheres, ſhould obtaine felicitie in the eternall recourſe of the heauens: which point <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> enforceth himſelfe to demonſtrate, in his moſt loftie part of Philoſophie, where repeating diuers conſiderations more loftie then in any other place, he ſharply contendeth for this eternitie of the world. And <hi>Iohn Leſcot</hi> ſeemeth to graunt him more then he requireth, when he ſaith, that the ſpirits are bleſſed, not only moouing the ſpheres, but for ſo much as by ſuch reuolution, ſeruing God, they communicate perfection to things here beneath. To which, agreeth that which <hi>Plotin,</hi> entreating of heauen, and of the ſoule of the world, ſaith, [It is an abſurd thing, and diſcordant, to ſuppoſe that that ſoule, which did for a time containe the heauen, ſhould not alwaies do the ſame, as if by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence it had contained it.] And thereupon he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth that the world ſhould endure for euer, becauſe the principall part of the ſoule thereof, cannot be diſſolued, nor the nature thereof em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo amongſt his other conſiderations inſerteth this, [That the prince of this worldly palace being eternall, not receiuing any viciſſitude, or chaunging, it is moſt likely that his palace ſhould alſo be eternall: and that his miniſters, or celeſtiall ſpirits, being altogither addicted to perpetuall motion, ſhould neuer take reſt.] But that we may vntie this knot, we will ſay, that it is an error of compariſon, to argue of that which hath his beginning immediately from God, in reſpect of the creator, and of that, which is here below, in regard of things aboue, and of the immediate ende of euerie thing in compariſon of his laſt ende.

And the immediate ende of man is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his houſe, and family, or the common-wealth; to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, trafficke, and ſuch like buſineſſes: but his lateſt ende is to attaine to God, or to felicitie, be it, as one would ſay through a Stoicall vertue, or by a Peripateticke contemplation, or by Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicke purifying, or (which is moſt certaine true) through faith, and grace according as our religion doth import. And alſo wee affirme that the immediate ende of the ſpirits ſeparated from God, and of the corruptible matter, is to gouerne the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and men, and ſuch other things, as haue beene committed to their charge. But their laſt ende is their onely contemplation of that firſt eſſence, from which they deriue their felicitie (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> himſelfe teſtifieth in his Ethickes.) Suppoſe then that they ceaſe to mooue, &amp; from their immediate end, yet ſhall they neuer ceaſe to be bleſſed: no more then man ſhall be leſſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, when he ſhall ceaſe to gouerne the common-wealth, or to performe his other temporall buſineſſes. And certainely it is maruellous that any can thinke, that the Angels, and celeſtiall ſpirits ſhould obtaine their happines, by moouing the heauens continually about, ſeeing that all moouings (as the Philoſophers teach) do tend to a reſting. But none can ſay that the ſpirits ſhall not ceaſe, becauſe they ſtill labour; but when they haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and performed their worke, and deliuered ſuch fauour to terreſtriall things, as they were charged with. And for the ſoule, whereof <hi>Plotin</hi> makes mention, one may likewiſe affirme that it ſhall not ceaſe to giue life to the Vniuers, when it ſhall ceaſe to mooue. For (as we haue alreadie heard) we maintaine not the annihilating of the elements, of the world, or the parts thereof; but rather the reſting after the motion: in ſuch ſort as all nature muſt be, in the ende, after ſundrie reuolutions reduced to the reſt of the Sabbaoth, vnknowne to many learned men. Let all thoſe then, who trouble themſelues without meane, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſearch out the end of the worldly frame, or contend about the originall thereof, here fixe their foote, leaſt running without ceaſing in their fantaſies after this perpetuall moouing, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reſt, and leaſt by no light, they can behold their repoſe, being alwaies troubled with a continuall courſe.

If it were to them that God might the better dwell at his eaſe, he had then an infinite time before dwelt in darkneſſe, as if in an hole, or by-corner. But if we thinke that he hath thus beautified heauen, and earth, becauſe he delighted in the diuerſitie thereof; what may this pleaſure of God be, whereof he was ſo long time before depriued? May it be for loue towards man, as you might inferre, that God made all theſe things? But hath this loue beene for wiſemen, or for fooles? if for the wiſe, then to ſmall purpoſe (God wot) hath this ſo exceeding great compiling of things beene made. If for the fooliſh, firſt there was no occaſion why God ſhoulde ſeeke to deſerue any thing of the euill; then what hath he gotten when euery one being a flatte foole is moſt miſerable, in that he is not wiſe?

And ſo it is that <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his booke of the world, after hauing in the beginning declared God, Prince, Gouernour, and Creator of this Vniuers, doth afterwards denie it, proceeding by reaſons deriued from ſenſe.

But ſay it is ſo: God ſhall haue no need of any thing, for this buſineſſe, no more then he had neede of a ſubiect, to make and compoſe his worke of: by reaſon that his creation, or diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is free, and deliuered from the lawes of naturall generation, and corruption, as we haue heeretofore already declared. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he neede of helpe, O <hi>Auicen,</hi> who through his proper power, and according to his owne good pleaſure, performeth of his owne liberalitie all things, not by nature, and neceſſitie, as thoſe imagine, to whom the eternall power of God, and his loue, for which he created the world, are hidden, as in the proceſſe of our diſcourſe, we may more amplie declare. But firſt let vs heare of AMANA, concerning thoſe things, which haue cauſed the Philoſophers to erre from the truth.</p>

                  <p>WE may by our precedent diſcourſe eaſilie vnderſtand what be the ſtrongeſt engins, which the Philoſophers haue planted (but in vaine) againſt the wals of ſupernall veritie, in this point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the creation, and we need not thinke it ſtrange that they be deceiued; for it is a doctrine, not vſurped by humane arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but infuſed into the harts of the ſmall ones and humble, through illumination by the holy ſpirite, which mocketh ſuch as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8737:21"/>
thinke themſelues wiſe, &amp; ſcorne all others; leauing them in the darknes of their blinded preſumption: as contrariwiſe the ſame ſpirit directeth, &amp; conducteth thoſe, whom he repleniſheth with his owne vertue, to contemplate in moſt cleere brightnes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent myſteries of God, and nature. But to the end that we may partly proceed to the diſcouery of their ignorance, who do arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly aſſume vnto themſelues the name of wiſedome, abuſing euen to this day many vnskilfull in the knowledge of pietie, by their graue &amp; ornate writings, being in ſhew and apparance like ſomewhat that ſauoreth, as it were ſolide &amp; entire, true &amp; profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: though being profoundly examined, one may finde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all cleane contrarie, &amp; a maruellous repugnancie not only ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally betweene them all, but euen in the particular writings of each of them. I would willingly aske to be reſolued of them in this point, how is it that they know the moſt bleſſed God (for now I ſpeake to ſuch as are not verie farre off from religion, and godlines; for as for Atheiſts, and ſuch as beleeue not God, we will deale with them apart in the ſequele of our diſcourſe) I doubt not but they will anſwere me, that they haue knowledge of God, by the motions, and other ſenſible things, which lead them by the hand to all ſuch things as may be knowne by vs. For theſe be their common ſayings. [All our knowledge proceedeth of ſenſe. And the experience of true diſcourſing is,<note place="margin">That by meanes of ſenſible things one cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the knowledge of God.</note> that it agree with that which is perceiued by ſenſe: that being beſt knowne, which beſt agreeth with ſenſe.] But I would entreat them to tell me if ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things haue an agreement of one and the ſelfe ſame name, or of a name common to manie, with the ſoueraigne God: It is moſt certaine that they are not of one ſignification, or name (to the ende that we may follow their owne inſtitutions, by which they teach that God, and things created, do not agree in a ſelfe ſame proportion of ſubſtance, or eſſence.) And if one nominate all kinds, he ſhall name them (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) by many ſundrie names. But if God and his workes, are diuers in reaſon; then is it no maruell if the Philoſophers proceeding by things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low deceiue themſelues in the knowledge of God. For how can they imagine of his high Maieſtie by the motions, &amp; theſe things ſenſible, ſeeing the Eternall is altogither exempt from ſenſe and motion? Doth not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirme, and after him <hi>Auerrois</hi> the Arabian, that God is altogither different from the manner of creatures? That he is the firſt moouer, not being mooued? Is it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8737:22"/>
not to depriue themſelues of the true knowledge of God by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, when they ſeparate him from the manner of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Let vs not thinke it ſtrange then, if thoſe, who admit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which they can inuent and compriſe by naturall reaſons and ſyllogiſmes deriued from ſenſible things, enforce themſelues to take from the Omnipotent many things, which are to them hidden, and vnknowne, being onely receiued by an holy intellect, and by a pure and celeſtiall thought diuinely infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: as are theſe verities following. [That God hath created the world: That of a free, and liberal will, he framed, and ordained it, when and according as it pleaſed him: That it belongeth to man, the maſter-peece of worke of his power, to conſider what this great God produced according to Nature, and what according to his bountie innate: How he dealt in his workes; briefly all the ſecrets of ſo wondrous a workeman.] But to returne to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I woonder how theſe Philoſophers will on one ſide diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh God altogither from the creatures, and on another ſide wil meaſure his al-mightines and power by that which they conſider of things here below. I would entreat them to heare (and yet they haue no occaſion heerein to doe it, for they know it well enough alreadie, I ſpeake therefore to their ſchollers) that which Saint <hi>Dennis</hi> firſt inſtructed in their doctrine,<note place="margin">Dennis in his Hierarchie.</note> and afterward lightened with the beames of the holy Ghoſt, hath ſaide of the Eternall. God (ſaith he) is euerie thing in excellencie. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good thing which we behold in theſe domeſticall things, wee muſt dedicate and appropriate the ſame to GOD in the moſt excellent ſort, that wee can. For euerie thing which appeareth faire in the worke, ſhould flouriſh much fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in the worker. And that which is in it ſelfe woorthie of the ſimpleſt,<note place="margin">The good, in a better is euer moſt excellent.</note> and meaneſt commendation, is in him found to be the beſt, and moſt excellent of all, for good in a better is euer moſt good. Good is wiſedome in a citizen, better in a Preſident, and moſt good in a king. Good is fortitude in a ſouldier, better in a captaine, but moſt good in a prince. The like is to be thought concerning clemency, liberalitie, and other vertues, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Sith then fecunditie, puiſſance, vigor, pietie, beautie, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and ſuch other properties doe ſhine in things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; much more muſt they in the diuine thought ſhoote out their beames in ſoueraigne brightnes. For in the creatures all theſe vertues, like borowed colours, doe point out the ſoule of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8737:22"/>
the world: but in the celeſtial prince, they flame out in raies of his infinite eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which vniteth al things, being appropriated &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated vnto it. See then how we muſt ſpeake, and beleeue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Soueraigne, and how to meaſure his workes by his omnipotencie, and power. But foraſmuch as the Philoſophers doe confeſſe that God is the firſt, and beſt of all things; and all other things are vnder him, and ſubiect to him; and that they praiſe, and commend in them, fertilitie, liberalitie, generation, and ſuch other vertues, and faculties; which from time to time do here make manifeſt their effects: wherefore ſhould they not acknowledge them in the Soueraigne good God, who ſaith in Eſay, [If I giue fruitfulnes to others, ſhall I be barren?] They may tell me that they ſeparate from God; not onely all that which feeleth his owne imperfection, but all that alſo, which wanteth of perfection: and thereof it ariſeth that they take from him all fertilitie, concerning things that are without him, leaſt any new thing, or alteration might bee attributed to the euerlaſting, and immutable: and likewiſe the libertie of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, leaſt as if imperfect,<note place="margin">Al things enforce themſelues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the image of God.</note> he might ſeeme to negotiate vnder hope of reward: and yet they denie him not the libertie, by which he worketh as is conuenient for him. Certainely theſe be ſubtile, and ſharpe allegations, and yet of ſmall force. For let me aske them, if all ſchooles teach not, that the things of this world enforce themſelues to their power, to repreſent the image of God? The Platoniſts in euerie diſcourſe, doe acknowledge it as well as the Theologians. Yea the Peripatetickes themſelues agree in this point, as their maſter teacheth in the ſecond treatiſe of the ſoule, in ſuch words. [It is the moſt naturall deed of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing things, ſo far forth as they be perfect, not impotent, to make another thing like to it ſelfe: as the beaſt a beaſt, the plant a plant, becauſe they participate of the diuine, and eternal eſſence, ſo much as they can. For all eſſences deſire it, and all things which follow their courſe according to nature, worke for the loue of it: but they cannot imitate it continually and with perpetuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, becauſe no corruptible thing attayneth to bee one and the ſame in number.] Theſe bee verie obſcure ſayings, but yet by them we may learne that all creatures tend according to their facultie, to agree with the ſemblance of God; and by how much more each member of this worldly body is more perfect, by ſo much more doth it enforce it ſelfe; as if in emulation, to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8737:23"/>
imitate the creator of it. It is true that <hi>Auerrois</hi> doth interpret this text of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> concerning heauen. But how ſhould the heauen be this Eternall, whom all things ſhould enforce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to follow, conſidering that it of it ſelfe is eternall, in fauour of whom, the elements, heauen it ſelfe, and euerie creature doth worke? Doth not the doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reſound in each point, that God is the end of all things, in deſire of whom they are moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as to the thing loued and deſired? But leauing this Arabian <hi>Auerrois,</hi> who ſtudieth in all his works to deface, &amp; marre many other ſentences of his maſter, that he may defend that which he imagineth; let vs conclude, that according as the Philoſophers confeſſe, the elements in their being, the plants in their life, and fruitfulnes, the liuing creatures in a better life, and in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch as it is, imitate in emulation the diuine power and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and that man endued with the ſingular gift of libertie, and free will doth in the ſame imitate God, and beareth in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate and condition, then any other thing, his image, and ſemblance: By ſuch conſiderations (ſay I) is alſo prooued the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and libertie of God, alwaies tending to good, according to his good pleaſure, becauſe he contayneth within himſelfe that which hee conferreth vpon others. And briefly to anſwere all their reaſons heretofore alleaged, let vs hold, that that Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne perfection, which is in God, wanteth not in the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, nor for the cauſe thereof, nor yet that his ſimple vnitie is diſtributed into a multitude, becauſe that in it ſelfe, by infinite power, it contayneth all things. Neither doth the intellectuall ſoule degenerate, although (as they teach) it exerciſeth the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to feele,<note place="margin">Proper faculties to be conſidered in God.</note> to ſtrengthen, to cauſe encreaſing, and to mooue according to his eſtate. For (that we may mount to higher conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations) God perceiueth with ſuch his ſenſes, as the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures attribute vnto him: He mooueth all other things, himſelfe remaining ſtable; he giueth them ſtrength, and feedeth them with the foode of his wiſedome. But hee performeth all theſe things by a meanes, by a perfection &amp; power, which is vnknowne to humane ſpirits, except they be illuſtrated with his light. And there is in him a fertilitie without trauel, which is the fountaine of all other things, through which he produceth alwaies within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but outwardly he doth it at the pleaſure of his will. Which becauſe it is the rule of contingence, it is not poſſible, nor fit for vs to ſearch out the cauſe of the firſt beginning. For when we are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8737:23"/>
thereto arriued, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe doth charge to ſtay: for God hath no need of any precedent diſpoſition, nor of helpe; neither did feare reſiſtance, nor was hindered by ſpace, he, who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding created all things. But the cauſes of things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the inſtruments and ſubiect framed by his word, require a precedent diſpoſition, haue need of an application, attaine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of time, and ſeeke ſuch helpes, as are requiſite for ſuch a one, as negotiateth by power limited. And therefore (as we haue alreadie ſaid) when they deduce their reaſons from theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and naturall workers, to him, which is free, and deliuered from all theſe things, they fall into diuers errors. But if by the workes, which they contemplate in this Vniuers, they do enforce themſelues to attaine to the knowledge of the Soueraigne Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect, then let them attribute vnto him all theſe things after a conuenient &amp; perfect manner: ſeparating from him all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth feeblenes, and impotencie in the worker. And then they ſhall ſee that the ſupreme things of the Architype, accord by a ſweete and melodious conſonancie to thoſe which are more baſe and meane; all which are compriſed in the creator, as in a modell and patterne, and contemplated by vs here below, as in a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or trace. But this ſhadow, and much more the trace, doth want much of him, whom they repreſent. And yet by them, as by a token, or priuie note, we attaine to ſome obſcure knowledge of the creator: although his workes doe agree with him neither in different proportion or ſignification, nor yet in al and through all in the ſame reaſon, but onely by a certaine reſemblance they repreſent vnto vs the perfect faſhion of ſupernall things, by their moſt groſſe and baſe nature euerie one in their degree. But this is ſufficient concerning this ſubiect: now ſpeake we of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of ſuch witneſſes, as make the creation of the world vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable, which we refer to you ARAM to declare vnto vs.</p>

And firſt we will recite thoſe, who being woorthie of credite, haue taught it vs. We haue alreadie ſeene how that the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> (concerning this generation of the world) accordeth with the doctrine of <hi>Moſes. Mercurius Triſmegistus</hi> in his <hi>Pimandre</hi> deliuereth in few words the ſame ſacred myſteries, rendring the compoſition of this Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and of the gouernors thereof, and of all things created, to be vndoubtable. And by the baſer elements he aduertiſeth vs of the pure workemanſhip of nature, vnited neuertheleſſe with the thought of the Creator. Which elements he affirmeth to be for this purpoſe, eſtabliſhed by the will of God onely, and yet in farre woorſe condition, then before they were in the worker. <hi>Empedocles</hi> of Agrigentum, and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> of Epheſus affirme not once, but oftentimes the world to be engendred, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible. <hi>Democritus</hi> teacheth, that it hath had beginning, that it one day muſt periſh, and neuer againe be renued. <hi>Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> the Poets ſing that it hath beene created. <hi>Thales</hi> one of the ſeuen Sages affirmeth,<note place="margin">Hieraclus.</note> that this round frame is the worke of God. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> &amp; <hi>Hieraclus</hi> his expounder, confeſſe God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, &amp; father of all things. To which accord <hi>Auicen Arabian, Alga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel Sarraſin, Philo</hi> no leſſe excellent in doctrine, then in Greeke eloquence, and <hi>Alcinois</hi> the Platoniſt, who ſaith, (It is neceſſarie for the vniuerſall world to be the perfectly-beautious worke of God.)

But leauing the teſtimonies of ſtrangers, let vs come to ſuch as haue receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuine oracles,<note place="margin">A certaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the doctrine of Moſes.</note> by ſupernatural illumination, that which they haue taught vnto vs. We haue heard that which <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth vs concerning the generation of the world, now let vs conſider how his doctrine, or rather the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by the mouth of ſo excellent a prophet, is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto vs by miracles, prodigies, oracles, and prophecies: and laſtly by the conſent of euery part of his writings; as alſo by the graue authoritie of thoſe who in their interpretations of them doe confirme and approoue them.<note place="margin">Of miracles. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.7.8.9.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> Concerning his miracles they are all moſt manifeſt to ſuch as haue read his bookes. The rod is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8737:24"/>
turned into a ſerpent, and againe returned into the former ſhape: It deuoureth the magicians rods, ſhewing that the ſorceries of vncleane ſpirits, and all their puiſſance and force is conſumed by the power of God, which wrought and dealt in <hi>Aaron</hi> and in <hi>Moſes.</hi> He bringeth foorth infinite little beaſts and of ſundrie ſorts, which pricke both man and beaſt: he draweth water out of the ſtone, giueth quailes from heauen, bringeth thunder, a cloud by day, and a piller of fire by night, and alſo the darke night, and doth all this by the word of the liuing Lord, who one while terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and another while comforteth his people. Hee ſendeth ſlaughter among the Egyptians, ſudden loſſe and ruine to the wicked, fire among the proud, and leproſie to her that murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and preſerueth for a long time a great number from ſicknes, and their garments from waxing old, and wearing. Moreouer he feedeth them with heauenly food, and giueth them victorie ouer all their enemies. Such things and many ſuch like things doth the ſoueraigne architect of this Vniuers performe by his prophet, to the end to approoue his doctrine, and to teach vs his truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. To this end alſo by the word of <hi>Moſes</hi> he appeaſeth monſters,<note place="margin">Prodigies.</note> cauſeth the thunder to ceaſe, healeth ſuch as were empoiſoned: to the end that ſo much the more through ſuch prodigies, his law, the wiſedome of life and doctrine, by which hee inſtructed his people, might be celebrated.

Who can accuſe them of falſhood? who wil make doubt of their doctrine? If one read the text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> all points therein are ſo repleniſhed with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and future euents, that there is nothing left out there concerning that which belongeth to the myſteries of diuine and philoſophicall matters, nor of the Meſſias then to come, nor yet of all whatſoeuer ſhould afterward come to paſſe; as is euident to thoſe who haue the eies of their mindes illuminated, and who vnderſtand the bookes of the law, to ſee cleane through a great many vailes, vnder which (as was moſt meete) the prophet did hide ſo many profound myſteries. What man then of ſounde iudgement that making ſmall or no account of ſuch and ſo great ſacraments, will rather then to beleeue in them, haue recourſe to the monuments of certaine Philoſophers, not approoued by ſo many witneſſes, and whoſe writings ſauour no whit of diuine matters? We may very well receiue their inſtructions ſo far as they differ not from the doctrine of holy writ: but we muſt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither reiect that which relying vpon their owne authoritie, or their owne inuention ſupported by their reaſons, and indeed not in many places ought woorth, (which) they induce beſides that which is contained in the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. For if we will ſhew reuerence to authors,<note place="margin">What authors are woorthie of beleefe.</note> to which I pray you, ſhoulde we ſhew more, either to <hi>Ariſtotle, Auerrois,</hi> Epicures, and ſuch like, who onely do ſhine with a ſmall light of humaine doctrine, or elſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the Prophets, to <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſeſt of all his time, to the Euangeliſtes, and to the Apoſtles, euerie of which in ſapience, in wiſedome, in manners, in prophecies, in oracles, and in all kinde of holines do ſhine, and flame like bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning torches? Who affirme in an vnuſed ſtile that which they ſpeake concerning diuine things, proouing them with perill of their liues, and confirming them by prodigies: and ſpeaking of things naturall, humaine, and baſe, aboue all common capacitie of men, and penetrating into moſt deepe ſecrets by illumination of the holy ſpirit, do with moſt bright cleerenes manifeſt them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8737:25"/>
to all thoſe which haue eies to ſee, and eares to heare. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath excellently written to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Euſebius in his eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie.</note> ſpeaking thus, (You ſhall finde out the errors of the Ethnick Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, not by me, but by the contradiction, and meruellous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie among themſelues: and when I compare them among themſelues, or with other common men, certainly I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denie but they haue beene woorthie perſonages; but when I conferre them with the Philoſophers and Theologians of the Hebrewes, and compare their doctrine, with the doctrine of thoſe, friuolous and vaine do all their inuentions ſeeme to mee.) Moreouer, know we not that by the one all things haue beene deliuered humanely, and by the others diuinely? And that thoſe who woulde taſte of the firſt draughts of wiſedome, haue beene conſtrained to learne of the Hebrewes? And therefore <hi>Porphirius</hi> in his booke of Abſtinence, adorneth with ſundrie praiſes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, or prophets among that people, calling them Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and aſſigning them the chiefeſt degree aboue all other Prophets and Magi, who haue made profeſſion of holines. And <hi>Orpheus</hi> in his booke which he hath written of the holy word, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he chaſed away all contemners of the diuine ordinances and myſteries, confeſſeth that he learned out of the tables of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that which he ſong of God, knowne onely but to his Prophet. But aboue all the foreſaide teſtimonies,<note place="margin">Conſent of the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt with that of Moſes.</note> woorthie to bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to them (that which ſurpaſſeth all admiration) the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the celeſtiall and diuine meſſenger Ieſus Chriſt, the true Meſſias, annointed with diuine graces, aboue anie other prophet, doth accord. Who allowing and approouing the doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> openeth and reuealeth many ſecrets, which he receiued of God his father, and announceth the perfection of true religion: wherewith his apoſtles haue ſo filled the whole worlde, that euen to this day, all the wiſe men in euerie part of the world do embrace and reuerence ſo excellent doctrine, as that, wherein ſhineth ſo much diuinity and celeſtiall brightnes, that without compariſon it ſurpaſſeth all humane doctrine. Let vs receiue it then, euen all of vs that deſire wiſedome, bicauſe that neuer any more excellent did euer yet appeere to mortall men, neither ſhall euer appeere heereafter.

                  <p>AMongſt thoſe other arguments, which we haue heard ſome Philoſophers, obiect againſt the creation of the world, one hath bin the diſconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie of the newnes thereof with eternall God, not being able to perceiue how and which way it might come to paſſe: for by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſideration of ſuch a like queſtion, to wit [which of the egge, or of the birde was firſt engendred; ſeeing that the egge without the birde, nor the bird without the egge could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt:] they haue imagined that this world was eternall, and that the beginning of euerie thing engendred, was the ende likewiſe thereof, through a perpetuall courſe, and proceeding. But let me aske theſe doctors,<note place="margin">Reaſons for the newnes of the world.</note> whence commeth this newnes which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold euerie day in all things of this world? For there is nothing which ſuffreth not viciſſitude, and chaunging. <hi>Auerrois</hi> ſaith, that this proceedeth from new reuolutions, which notwithſtanding are auncient by an euerlaſting ſucceſſion: and that there is the ſtay where the oldnes, and newnes is conſerued. For which cauſe alſo ſome haue affirmed, that heauen is ſome part new, ſome part old. But for as much as theſe Philoſophers do teach, that reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made by thoſe diſpoſing ſpirits, which are called the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the creator, or of the firſt moouer, doth it not thereupon follow, that there is no ſtay in the heauens, but that they mooue anew to accompliſh that which the firſt moouer doth propoſe in a certaine time to be performed, and who remayning ſtable doth giue motion to all the reſt? Wherefore we may ſay that the beginning of newnes cannot bee from heauen, nor through the ſpirits, but by the firſt moouer, who at his good pleaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8737:26"/>
and all things are made, and afterwards renued by a ſecret order within himſelfe not conſtrayned by any neceſſitie. For ſo it is that God proceedeth to his worke, and ſo proſecuteth it, without being otherwiſe bound to baſe things: which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> himſelfe accordeth to, when he declareth that he is bleſſed, without any good that is ſtrange, or not of himſelfe. And farther I would willingly know with what kinde of meaſure they would meate out the Vniuers, who beare ſuch fauour to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the world? If by time (it be meaſured) then is not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, for thoſe reaſons which we haue deliuered heretofore in the diſcourſe concerning the time of the Creation. If by eternitie (it ſelfe) then let them remember that that is a poſſeſſion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither ſeparated from time, and from motion, as hath beene to vs ſufficiently declared. How then can this world be eternall which is equall in age to Time, and altogither ſubiect to Motion?<note place="margin">That the world cannot be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> But if any one yet would hold that it is eternal, let him tell me, whether it endureth by the ſelfe ſame eternitie which is in the bleſſed God, or by ſome other? If it be by another ſort of eternitie, then ſhould there be diuers eternities of gouernours, and of kindes, which ſhould ſauour of the nature of the infinite: and alſo many infiniteneſſes ſhould be contained in this world which is ſo ſmall. If they will ſay, that the world ſubſiſteth of the ſame eternitie by which God is; certainely ſuch are not worthie of any anſwere, but rather to be mocked at, who thinke the ſpheres, and their mouers to be meaſured with God: for eternal enduring dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not from God. But that which is changeable according to Nature, and operation cannot be meaſured with the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, as he who is altogether vnchangeable. They will tell me that the eternitie of the world differeth from that of the firſt agent; becauſe the one being altogither diuine is a poſſeſſion at once altogether, and the other is ſucceſſiue. But I anſwere them that if it be ſucceſſiue, it hath certaine portions; now ſuch por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be infinite, and therefore ſuch eternitie hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and ſucceſſiue ending. Now if it be limited and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with theſe termes, how can it be that it may agree with the eternall, who is not cloſed, or limited by any ending? Beſides, by what reaſon may this be called eternall, to which alwaies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is added by a continuall ſucceſſion? For one can adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the infinite, neither doth it encreaſe at all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aske them againe that if their eternitie ſubſiſteth, what do
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8737:27"/>
become of the new reuolutions? Shall we ſay they are conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the former, or elſe that they begin a new infiniteneſſe? If they graunt the firſt, then will they be more in number then infinite. <hi>Auerrois</hi> ſaith, that this is no more diſagreeable to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, then to numbers, that infinite tens be infinitely repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which amount to ſo much as innumerable hundreths, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any more encreaſe in one part then in another. But good God who can heare theſe things with a quiet eare? By an impoſſible ſuppoſition which he deuiſeth in numbers, and which neuer commeth to paſſe, he would reſolue the inconueniences which depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon infinit reuolutions, which he ſaith did precede al eternity. And for the other point, to thinke that the new reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions ſhould begin a new infinitenes, we haue already anſwered that, ſaying, that many infiniteneſſes cannot be imagined in this world. But here leauing the ſucceſſions &amp; numbers, I would far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requeſt theſe defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders of the eternity of this round frame to tell me, whether the moouing ſpirits knowe the reuolutions, or not? If they know them not, certainly men doe them much iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to thinke, that they are ignorant in their motions, which many Aſtronomers know. If they know them all (being) infinite, how is it that by a finite vnderſtanding, which is in all creatures, they may comprehend things (that are) infinite?<note place="margin">Reaſon taken from generation.</note> Againe, ſith that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is bounded and limited by the vndiuidable, and the laſt generation of any creature whatſoeuer by the laſt creature, what generation ſhall we ſay to be limited to the firſt? If they ſay there is no former, how is it then that there can be a latter? I woonder alſo at thoſe ancient Sages of the world, and the moderne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe which follow them, when they declare all things to be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ordained in God as in the laſt wiſhed, and deſired end; and yet doubt to confeſſe that he is the ordainer, conſidering alſo that they call him the firſt moouer. But if he hath ordained all things,<note place="margin">Another of the moderation and gouernment of things.</note> it followeth likewiſe that he muſt know them. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that which ſome inferre, that God hath onely diſpoſed the vppermoſt and higheſt things, and that the ſecond cauſes engender the loweſt: I demaund of them, how it is that thoſe here belowe are correſpondent to thoſe which are moſt high, conſidering there are diuers ordainers? Doth not <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſay, <hi>[That there is but one onely prince, for feare least things ſhould be euilly diſpoſed and gouerned?]</hi> Againe, if all things depend of a deſired and finiſhing cauſe, ſo that in fauour thereof they become great:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8737:27"/>
how is it that they haue a being of themſelues, ſeeing they ſeeke to be perfect in another? Why haue thoſe any need of a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: which haue no need of a creator? Indeed the ſon is preſerued without the father, but without him he is not engendred. For what occaſion then doe theſe philoſophers giue a keeper to the members of the Vniuers, and do take cleane away from it anie parents? What lies doe they bring vnto vs that accuſe others to be ſellers of lies? For in one place they miſconſter and denie that, which in another place the truth conſtraineth them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. <hi>Auerrois</hi> in many places of his writings,<note place="margin">How the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers contrarie themſelues.</note> denieth that God created the world; and yet, interpreting the treatiſe of heauen, he calleth him Creator. So likewiſe <hi>Aristotle</hi> proceeding by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things mocketh at <hi>Plato,</hi> that at euery word confeſſeth the world to be created: and in the booke which he entituleth <hi>Of the World,</hi> hee auoucheth God to bee Creator of the Vniuers. And in his Metaphyſicks he teacheth that hee is Prince of the world. And how is it that the Prince is entred into an houſe which he neither hath builded, nor obtained by right of inheritance, nor bought with any ſumme of money? This is as he affirmeth that the ſupreme thought vnderſtandeth not the particular matters, for feare leaſt he ſhould ouer-labour, or elſe weare himſelfe. And yet in the treatiſe of good, and bad fortune, he often repeateth, that he hath excellent good fortune that is guided by God. But how doth he guide and direct that which he vnderſtandeth not? And how doth he render condigne recompenſe, and reward for things well or ill done (as it is ſaide in the ſame Treatiſe) if hee doth not conſider and examine the workes of euery one? Againe we read in the Meteors, that God hath placed the pure fire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the globe of the Moone: and yet how hath he diſpoſed and ordained that, which he neither made, nor hath knowledge of? Surely it woulde be a tedious matter to bring out all the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and repugnances of the writings of Philoſophers, which do plainly confound themſelues. But out of much I haue ſelected this little, to the end that thoſe who boaſt rather of the name of Peripateticks, or Auerroiſts, then of good Theologians, and Chriſtians, may behold, that all their teachings are not ſolid, nor firme. Let vs inſert among our reaſons, which confound their doctrine, the iudgement of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> of <hi>Macrobius,</hi> and of many other learned men, who hold that the eternitie of the world cannot ſubſiſt, and haue place with ſo ſmall memorie of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8737:28"/>
things done, as we haue in our hiſtories, as well holy as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, neither yet with the inuention of arts and many other things celebrated by <hi>Euſebius, Pamphilus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Beroſus</hi> the Chaldee, <hi>Aristotle, Auerrois, Theophrastus, Epigenes, Critodemus, Philostophanes Egeſius, Archimachus, Damaſthenes, Aulus Gellius,</hi> and a great number of others of diuers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and moſt plentifully by <hi>Pliny</hi> in his booke of the naturall hiſtorie, where he confeſſeth to haue collected part of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings out of the ſaid authors;<note place="margin">The eternitie of the world cannot agree with hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries &amp; inuention of things.</note> with whom alſo, in that which they teſtifie of the inuention of things, the holy letters are of great authoritie, in that they do agree with them herein in many points. For although there be ſome difference concerning the names of thoſe which haue inuented them, as the forenamed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do not alwaies agree among themſelues; yet the inuention found in time, is wholy confirmed by the ſame reaſon, and all that which diſagreeth, is come either by reaſon of the languages, not being alike, or bicauſe that Hiſtoriographers, cheefely the Greekes, haue attributed that to their nation, which properly appertained not to them. Now if the world had beene from the beginning, yea euen before the beginning, as many would haue it: why then in the ſucceſſiue courſe of innumerable ages, was not that policie and kinde of liuing inuented, which we vſe at this preſent? Why not the vſe of letters, by which onely, memorie is made eternall? Why not the experience of many things? For none of all this is found to be, but within and ſince fiue thouſand fiue hundred yeeres, ſo long as the Scripture teacheth vs that the world hath beene created, being from the creation thereof to the natiuitie of Ieſus Chriſt (according to the common compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) three thouſand nine hundred ſixtie ſeuen yeeres; what did the inhabitants of the world before this time ſo briefe and ſhort being compared with eternitie, &amp; to which the hiſtories do refer the inuentors &amp; vſe of all things? Liued men then without policie, and without lawes? without bread, without wine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tillage of the earth? were they without the exerciſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, without the ſtudie of good letters, of diſcipline, of warfare, of nauigation, of building, of weauing, of ſowing, of dreſſing wooll: all which things haue their inuention famous but within a few yeeres, and in diuers ſeaſons? wherewith liued they before? where dwelt they? how were they clothed? what did they being altogither ignorant of artes? Certainely it is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8737:28"/>
meere mockerie, that thoſe who teach that the world is eternall, do themſelues aſſigne the inuentors of lawes, of arts, and of mens liuing, conſidering that both the one and the other coulde not conſiſt both at one inſtant. Behold (companions) that which ſeemed good to me to note concerning the reaſons making for the creation, the hiſtorie whereof will put vs altogither out of doubt in that which toucheth the principall arguments of the Philoſophers againſt it, if wee doe amplie entreate of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, when they maintaine that God worketh of neceſſitie, and not of free and franke will, which will ſerue vs to morrow for a ſubiect to begin the daies diſcourſe.</p>

But ere we doe farther enter into the cabinets of God and nature, it would not be vnfruitefull if wee yet haue an other pull with the Philoſophers about this queſtion [Whether of neceſſity, or of free choiſe, and franke will God was prouoked to worke?] For they ſuppoſed that the condition of neceſſitie was fitter and more conuenient then was the matter of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and therefore they appropriate it to God. Wherein they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8737:29"/>
thinke verily to want no reaſons for their purpoſe, and that theſe make ſpecially for them [That God worketh by his proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,<note place="margin">If the worke of God be of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, or volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> and not by any borrowed vertue: That the effectes of the world, are of neceſſity, becauſe they ſeeme in no wiſe to proceed of a contingent cauſe; that by the ſame reaſon is to be conſidered the inuariable, and neceſſarie order of thinges, to the end that the vniuers be not confounded or troubled] Moreouer the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſuppoſed that it was a very vnfit thing, for the diuine vnderſtanding to worke of neceſſity, and the diuine will to worke freely, conſidering that it is no leſſe perfect then the diuine thought. Now though that we (concerning theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) night take out of the quiuer of reaſonable diſcourſe arrowes enow againſt theſe Sages of the world, yet for that this point doth particularly touch the diuinity, it may ſuffice to ſay with <hi>Plato,</hi> that one cannot picke out ſo great a myſterie by reaſons, but ſeeke to learne the ſame by oracles. For it is ſufficient to know that the great lawgiuer recordeth that [God ſpake,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But here let vs declare, that that which ſeemeth thus to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the Philoſophers, is nothing at all: For they preſuppoſe a neceſſarie diſpoſition to bee more perfect then the contingent cauſe: which they haue left to prooue, to thoſe that ſhould come afterwards. Now I beſeech you, do we not more eſteeme a Prince, who directeth euerie thing according to his owne good pleaſure, then if vrged by nature, or any other prouocation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning him, he ſhould ſet his hand to any buſines? Who will blame libertie, which (as the Prouerbe ſaith) is hardly bought for gold? That, I ſay, which they themſelues thinke to haue beene graunted man for a moſt ſingular good? What perfection, what praiſe ſhould be attributed to moſt loftie thoughts, if they were euer forced to performe that which is good?<note place="margin">Liberty profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all things.</note> What dignitie might appertaine to a great king, if he did all things neceſſitie conſtrayning him, and nothing of a generous heart? And ſeeing by common conſent, we acknowledge God to be the Prince of the world, what glorie and honor ſhould be giuen him for his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, for his wiſedome, for his iuſtice, for his clemencie, if of neceſſity, and conſtraint he were drawne on to maintaine that, which is in his tuition? What grace, what ſeruice, and adoration
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8737:29"/>
ſhould we owe him? Why is it entred into nature, to ſacrifice, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith? Why are we obliged (as <hi>Auerrois</hi> himſelfe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) to magnifie God the creator in prayers and ſacrifices? If God doth all things of neceſſitie, what profiteth all this? For what cauſe is it conuenient for vs to pray,<note place="margin">Prayers are fit for men.</note> if God be not appeaſed by prayer? To what ende hath all mankinde in euerie age, in all places, of euery nation beene addicted to adore a diuinity? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may thereof gather that prayers are fit for men; and that it is naturally grafted in our minds that God is mooued by them. So manie reaſons then may well conclude, that the author of Nature doth neuer negotiate of neceſſitie. And for that that he worketh by a proper ſubſtance, that is not of eternitie, except in the ſpiritual worke, from himſelfe, wherof we haue ſpoken in the 5. of our diſcourſe. But for the outward worke he proceeded thereto, according to his owne will, when it pleaſed him; not conſtrayned by any cauſes (for hee is the onely and principall cauſe of all things) nor for hope to get any good (for that he of himſelfe is bleſſed, not hauing neede of any other good.<note place="margin">God is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any order of nature.</note>) Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore alſo, the neceſſarie effects conclude not any neceſſitie in the prince, or in the firſt cauſe, conſidering that the ſecond cauſes, which <hi>Plato</hi> and the other Sages call his ſeruants, doe worke by his commaundement in determined order; ſo that the neceſſitie that therein is, dependeth vpon his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, or vpon the order, from which he abſolueth them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne good pleaſure.<note place="margin">

I leaue, for this point, the other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Philoſophers, Gentiles, Chaldees, Egyptians, Phenicians, Greekes, the Sibilles, and many Hiſtorians brought for proofe of the ſupernaturall effectes of omnipotent God, by <hi>Ioſephus, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> whereof each by their writings may ſufficiently inſtruct. And if authoritie doe ought auaile in diſputation, let then the depoſition of ſo many Sages preuaile in this point, in a matter that <hi>Aristotle</hi> &amp; his fautors denie in words onely. Moſt prudently certaine doth <hi>Auicen</hi> thinke that moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neither neceſſarie, nor violent, but in a meane betwixt both, in ſuch ſort, that it euer reſteth at the pleaſure of the Prince. And therefore it muſt be graunted that the ſecond cauſes are ſo alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the firſt cauſe, that they doe nothing but as the other commaunds them. And yet it ſo gouerneth thoſe things which it hath created and ordayned, that it permitteth them to performe their ordinarie proper motions. Now becauſe that it ſeldome hapneth to the contrary, and that the order of their firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perſeuereth in many things, and that moſt commonly: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> iudge that it was naturall, and neceſſarie. For as he ſaith in his treatiſe of naturall hearing, [That is naturall which commeth to manie, and oftentimes:] And ſo could he make no farther ſearch by ſenſible things. But the operations of God,<note place="margin">By the neceſſitie of effects one muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the cauſe.</note> and the alliance of things here below, with the firſt cauſe may not be ſearched out by diſcourſe of reaſons, but muſt rather, as we haue declared, be learnt of oracles. Thus is conuinced of nullitie, the progreſſe which is deduced from neceſſitie, appearing in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, to the neceſſitie of the cauſe: becauſe that neceſſitie of the effects dependeth vpon the order eſtabliſhed by the firſt cauſe. And the effects alſo are not needefull becauſe they are all particular: for the worke of nature is not bounded by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall All, but by each particular which the Peripateticks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues do rather nominate contingence, then neceſſarie. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt ſubtile Philoſophers do yet debate, that they be eternall, and that moſt needefull is the coherence of the ſubiect, with the worker; in which the proper eſſentiall, or the quidditie, (as they terme it) is named of the ſubiect: we may re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der them an other reaſon for this pretended neceſſity: to wit, the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things with the exemplaries or eternall Ideas, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8737:31"/>
by <hi>Plato,</hi> and defended by many ſage and great perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,<note place="margin">God hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all things by himſelfe.</note> as hath alreadie beene ſhowen. For this cannot conſiſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the vniuerſall is a ſimple eſſence, which produceth nothing by the ſecond cauſes, nor by the ſpirits, nor by nature, but only by himſelfe: and alſo the firſt cauſe of all things created, before euer any ſoule, or any heauen, or any other particular thing, whatſoeuer was produced. To returne therefore, from whence we ſtrayed, the effect enſueth the ordinance, &amp; immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order of the ſupreme cauſe, if by the ſame it be not otherwiſe inſtituted. And whereas the Philoſophers adde farther, that the will of God hath equall perfection with the thought, which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth of neceſſitie: we confeſſe that it taketh place, but it is in regard of the worke within himſelfe, wherby he enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the perfect image of himſelfe, his word, the abſolute Idea, and true patterne of all things. But we ſay, that he diſplayeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good pleaſure the outward effects, that from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting the diuine thought hath deſcribed in the word. Surely I woonder at the Sages of the world, who acknowledge that God is moſt ſimple, and of himſelfe moſt perfect, all other ſtrange thing ſet apart, and yet preſently (as if they had forgot their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) thinke that God hath a needfull bond with things heere below, as if he could not ſubſiſt without them, nor yet be bleſſed. And how is he moſt ſimple, if he hath a neceſſary bond with other things? How is he prince of all things, if he be obliged to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the moſt baſeſt? What dignitie, or what condition hath he of a ſoueraigne gouernour? Briefly to conclude this matter, let vs take away all neceſſitie from the Lord in regard of this round frame: and let vs not doubt that the order of this Vniuers ſhall decay, or be deſtroyed; if it be ſo, that the creator doth diſpoſe, and varie it at his good pleaſure: for he doth know how euer to direct in order, that which he hath once made, and ordayned. For none neede to feare the ſpoile of the worke, when the work-maſter ſets hand thereto, by whoſe handling it is rather made perfect, then any whit marred. But yet before, we take any other ſubiect, we muſt firſt heare of AMANA, the reaſons which declare that God proceeded of free-will to his worke.</p>

                  <p>ALthough that by our precedent diſcourſe we may eaſily iudge, ſuch (as maintaine that God of eternitie did by neceſſitie his outward work) woorthie rather to be deſpiſed then refuted, being againſt the doctrine of diuine oracles: yet we will run ouer a few points, by which they themſelues ſhall be pearſed with their owne dartes. I would therefore firſt, deſire them to tell me from whence come the monſters in nature? They may ſay, that this proceedeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by defect, or ſuper-abundance of matter: or elſe bicauſe that the qualities anſwere not in due proportion; or through cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the containing part, and ſuch other conſiderations, which are ſubdiuided by phiſitions into their ſpecies. But let me aske them, if that the naturall cauſes worke neceſſarily, why doe they not performe euery thing duly, ſeeing nature (as they ſay) wanteth nothing in neceſſarie things? How then doe naturall cauſes worke of neceſſitie, when they faile? They may anſwere, that I would thereupon conclude, that they worke by contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which if I ſaide, what might follow thereon? But to leaue all ſuperfluous debate, let them remember, that it is an olde ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence vſed in ſchooles, that a thing is ſaid to be neceſſarie in two ſorts: the one abſolutely neceſſarie; and the other conditionally neceſſarie. Wherefore we attribute the firſt to God alone;<note place="margin">A thing is ſaid to be neceſſary two waies.</note> and the other to his creatures: ſo as we call them neceſſary according to the order appointed by the ſupreme creator. Which if the Philoſophers denie, we will vrge them with the worke it ſelfe of theſe cauſes. For it is certaine, that if they be faultie, and produce monſters, it commeth to paſſe, becauſe that order which is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them by nature (as they ſay) or rather of the ſoueraigne creator (as truth is) doth faile them. Now if they faile of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it then followeth, that it was not ſimply neceſſarie for them, but giuen by the firſt cauſe, through vertue whereof, the reſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained vnder it do worke: from which if the firſt withdraw it ſelfe, they do not onely faile, but become nothing at all. And if
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8737:32"/>
they may ſeeme to performe any thing of neceſſitie; this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto them by reaſon of the law, which hath beene giuen them by the Prince of Nature: who giuing lawes to others, is no whit for that therto himſelfe obliged. They may reply, that if our doctrine might ſtand, there ſhould be no certaintie of ſcience, conſidering that it ſhould conſiſt of things, which otherwiſe might be: whereto <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth make deniall. But we anſwere, that if he intendeth that thoſe things which are knowne ſhould be neceſſarie according to the order of the vniuers: the like may enſue in thoſe things, which may happen contrarie to the order, according to the diſpoſition of the eternall will. Now if they finde too great difficultie herein for their capacitie, what neede wee care? Let themſelues (if they thinke good) vnlooſe the knot. For fire may well be without burning,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. The effect may be ſeparated from the cauſe.</note> as indeed it hath beene, as we haue heard in the former ſpeech. And likewiſe euerie effect may be ſeparated from the cauſe, which hath produced it; yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the bond remayning, by a certaine correſpondencie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the worker and the ſubiect (that we may vſe ſchoole termes.) But proceeding farther, I would faine learne of theſe Peripatetickes, whence it is, that things haue a neceſſarie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant. They will ſay that it is by nature, as they prooue by experience.<note place="margin">What truely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is.</note> But what is this their nature? Nothing truely, but the author of the Vniuers, which is the true ſpirit not erring, ſeeing that (as they teach) the worke of nature, is the worke of the intelligence not erring, and by the ordinance whereof, all things haue a due courſe. For there is nothing but ſerueth this ſupreme worker. [<hi>He ſtretcheth out</hi> (ſaith the prophet) <hi>the heauens like a curtaine.</hi>

And from whence fetcheth demonſtration his originall? Is it not from thoſe principles, whoſe termes being knowne, we accord to them, or prooue them by experience?

declared, and wherewith (for all that) he is but little aided in his diſcourſe concerning nature. For herein he proceedeth alwaies by thoſe maximes that he taketh to be confeſſed: ſo that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration whereto his diſciples giue beleefe, is nothing elſe but a conſequence drawne from the place of authoritie, or from the foundations by him ſuppoſed. Wherefore let vs rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the holy ſcripture, which inſtructeth vs, that many things, and eſpecially diuine, are knowne through the beames of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall illumination, and by the couenant of the holy word with our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding touched by the truth. Let Epicures &amp; Atheiſts then maintaine how they liſt from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That to knowe,<note place="margin">What it is to know.</note> is to vnderſtand by demonſtration. For vs it is ſufficient to hold our inſtructions from the prophets taught by the diuine oracle: who by miracles, and prodigies, and great ſacraments, approoue (as we haue already heard) that which they teach. And if we ſay that knowledge is an vnderſtanding by any thing, we may take our ſelues to be wiſe in beleeuing the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, not any whit accounting of the Peripateticks, who haue only kindled the light of their contemplation by the moouing formes of the vniuers, and haue not been able, with a pure cogitation, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template him, who poſſeſſeth the higheſt degree of dignitie amongſt all eſſences, as their ſoueraigne prince, and gouernour: hauing in the reſt, rather giuen an artificiall fineneſſe, and baſe manner of proceeding, then any ſcience. And this is that which priuily their Maſter confeſſeth, when he entreateth of the laſt Analyticks, or Reſolutions, ſaying, that Science is of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and demonſtration of the quiddities, as he nameth it, and by the proper differences of things to vs vnknowne. For thereupon it followeth, that the principles of demonſtration are vnknowne, and that from them one may bring, no whit, or very little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. But reſuming our principall point of the free,<note place="margin">That the worke of the Vniuers is freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</note> and franke will of God in his worke, begun in time, we will argue more liuely thus. [Seeing that the partes of this vniuers, are ſo diſpoſed, that without any contrarietie, or contradiction, they might haue been otherwiſe ordered, it followeth, that they are contingent, and not ordained of neceſſitie, but of free will.] <hi>Auerrois</hi> ſaith: [We confeſſe not, that the partes of the world could be altered, bicauſe the world is an animal.] But I anſwere, in what place of <hi>Aristotle</hi> learnt he this manner of diſputing? He will that his authoritie ſhould be for a principle of demonſtration.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8737:33"/>
Moreouer from whence draweth he the conſequence? Let him tell me, if the world be an animal, whether is it ſenſible, or inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? If it be void of ſenſe, then is it no animal. If it be ſenſitiue: doth it ſee then? doth it heare, doth it ſmell, doth it taſte, doth it eate?<note place="margin">Whether the world be an animall.</note> But ſay we confeſſe the world to be an animal (as it ſeemeth that <hi>Plato,</hi> and many other Sages would affirme) ſurely it is no animal, contained vnder the kinde of animals. For all things in this frame are diuided by all philoſophers into a former diuiſion, before you come to the animal. But let vs confeſſe that it may be called an animal by ſome kinde of anſwerablenes and likenes: Wherefore then could not the diſpoſition of the partes thereof be otherwiſe ordained? Why ſhould it be diſagreeable for man, to haue onely one eie in his forehead, as it is reported of ſome? Why could it not be made, to the other creatures, the vpper iaw moouing, and the vndermoſt firme, as the crocodile alone hath? Why haue not ſundry beaſts two knees, like the camell? Surely theſe, and ſuch like things haue been ſo diſpoſed by the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne creator, that without any contradiction, or contrarietie, might haue been otherwiſe ordained, if we preſuppoſe not the condition of the nature ſpecified, ſuch as the creator himſelfe, hath according to his will prefixed. But let vs farther proceede concerning the animall the world.<note place="margin">Of the courſe and ſtraight paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Ocean.</note> By what neceſſitie hath the ſea bin in ſuch ſort diſpoſed, that the ocean ſhould paſſe through the narrow ſtraights of Abyla &amp; Calpe (high mountaines, which antiquitie called Hercules-pillers?) What neede is there that from thence it ſhould ſpread it ſelfe in length and bredth? That then it ſhould ſtretch it ſelfe into the Tuſcan, or Tirrhene ſea? afterward gathering it ſelfe into the Adriaticke gulph, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging it ſelfe into the Siriacke ſea, ſo running about by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean (which for the beautious number of iſles therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is named the Archi-pelagus, or princeſſe of ſeas) and from thence ſhrinking betweene moſt narrow paſſages the Heleſpont is made? And againe the Propontick where it dilateth it ſelfe, and where againe it is ſtraightened, is called the Thracian Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus? Then this Ocean being once againe widened, there is made the ſea Euxine, that is to ſay the hoſt, ſince the manners of the barbarous nations haue been poliſhed, and made ciuill, for it was firſt called <hi>Axenes,</hi> that is the inhumane hoſt, bicauſe of the cruell, and fierce nature of the dwellers thereabout: And againe mixing it ſelfe with the lake of Meotis, it is named the Cimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8737:33"/>
Boſphorus? What neede is there alſo why Nilus paſſing by the Ethiopians, and Arabians into Egypt: and Tanais paſſing through the one and other Scythia,<note place="margin">Of Nilus and Tanais.</note> and running almoſt into the midſt of the lake of Meotis, ſhould diſtinguiſh and ſeparate the three partes of the world? And by what other needfull ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is one part of the earth laid lowe in vallies, another ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out into plaines: this part raiſed vp in billocks, that lifted vp in loftie mountaines; and that the flouds and euer-running fountaines and ſtreames doe flowe in their ſeaſons? Of what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie alſo are ſome beaſts of the earth fruitfull, others barren? theſe drie, and thoſe moiſt? Might not we eaſily (without any contrarietie or repugnancie) imagine all the circuit of the earth to be plaine, ſoft, and bearing fruit? And if God can performe that which we cannot thinke, as all the Sages who haue beleeued in him doe affirme, why can he not doe that which we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine? Which if he can eaſily performe, theſe things then are not of neceſſitie, no otherwiſe then of eternitie, diſpoſed in ſuch ſort as we ſee them, but according, and how, and when it hath pleaſed the ſoueraigne creator of them. Now ynough is ſaide of theſe things: we muſt farther proceed in the conſideration of Gods works, wherein will greatly aide vs, the vnderſtanding of one onely principall and prime cauſe of the vniuers; that we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards comprehend the maruellous effects thereof.

But on this point wee may note, that amongſt all thoſe, which haue taught that the matter was the principall ſubiect, we haue one alone, who telleth vs, whether it hath beene created by the bleſſed God, or whether this nature pliable, and depriued of all beawty togither with God hath made the world: or elſe if, voide of all faſhion, it hath beene coeternall wife and companion of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> father of the Gods (as Poets faine) or if like a <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> it hath beene borne of <hi>Iupiters</hi> braine. Certainly our minde can finde no repoſe, when we finde a nature depriued of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and all forme, without the maker and creator thereof. Now who, or what he hath beene, we haue none of theſe Philoſophers, that can relate vnto vs. Very well ſee we that they agree very ill togither, in the doctrine of the principles and foundations of the world; which doubtleſſe hapned vnto them, bicauſe they did ſtraie very farre off from the vnity, maſter of all veritie, in whom they ſhoulde all haue met, and yet euery one went a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall way, following the inuentions of their naturall ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

temerariouſly preſuming by their owne proper powers to manifeſt that, which God would rather haue kept cloſe, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; to wit, the nature of celeſtiall things.

We haue already made mention of the time, ſince which, we hold the creation thereof: now muſt we conſider the ſpace of daies which are mentioned by <hi>Moſes</hi> in recitation of this Maſter-peece of worke of the Almightie, wherein the prophet hath concealed a myſterie of high, and difficult vnderſtanding.

much more to expreſſe. For the daies which we haue now, haue their euening and morning, the ſetting and riſing of the ſunne: and the three firſt daies whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh, paſſed without the ſunne, which was created the fourth day.

They alledge alſo, that the prophet repeating the creation which he ſeemed to haue diſtinguiſhed by daies, ſaid thus in the ſecond of Geneſis. [Theſe are the generations of the heauens and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heauens and the earth; and euery plant of the field

before it was in the earth, and euery herbe of the field, before it grew:] Whereby (they ſay) doth euidently appeere that al things were created togither.

Thus much for their opinions. But others contend to the contrarie, and maintaine that God hath diſtinguiſhed the creation of the world by certaine degrees and courſe of daies, according as <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth them, to keepe vs the more attentiue, and to conſtraine vs to abide in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his works. For it is moſt certaine that we paſſe lightly ouer the infinite glorie of God, which ſhineth vnto vs here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and the vanitie of our vnderſtanding doth willingly carrie vs away. To correct which vice, his diuine bountie would temper his works to our capacity. And they which hold this opinion haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how the text before cited out of Eccleſiaſticus, wherein this word (togither) is read, is not properly ſo in the Greeke copie: but the Greeke word ſignifieth (likewiſe) or (in common,) and hath relation not to the time, but to the vniuerſalnes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie of creatures. Now to reconcile theſe diuers opinions, me thinketh we may ſay, that for the matter, and rich ſeede of all the beauties and richeſſes of the vniuers, it hath been created of God all in one moment; but that afterward he gaue forme to it, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of them the works, which he did in the ſixe daies.

And God ſaw the light that it was good; and God ſeparated the light from the darkenes: and God called the light day, and the darkenes he called night.

                     </note> how Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> accuſtomed to mount (as we haue ſaid) with the wings of contemplation vnto the Anagogicall ſenſe, diſcourſing vpon this point, concerning the light, which was ſaid to haue beene created the firſt day, with euening and mormng, three daies before the ſun; confeſſeth freely, that it is farre-remote from our ſenſe, what light this is, and by what alternate motion, the euening and morning were made: and he vſeth this diſiunctiue queſtion [whether it were ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall light (that is, ſome lightſome bodie) in the higheſt parts of the world farre from our ſight: or elſe a light without bodie, in ſome place, whereat the ſunne was ſhortly after kindled: or elſe by the name of light,<note place="margin">

And if louing and contemplating him, they acknowledge all things in him (which knowledge is much more certaine, then if one ſhould view them indirectly) then is it day. But it is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the angell turneth himſelfe from God to things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, regarding them not in him, but in themſelues. And yet this euening commeth not to night, becauſe theſe angelicall thoughts neuer preferre the workes before the workman; neither haue them in greater eſtimation, for ſo ſhould it bee moſt profound night. Behold then, how deepely Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth diſcourſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8737:38"/>
in this place concerning the euening and morning. But for the place before-cited concerning the point of the light, he referreth the ſame termes, euening and morning, to the condition of our ſoule. For he ſaith, that that, which it can know and vnderſtand in compariſon of the knowledge of God, is like an euening, and that yet when it is bent to praiſe and loue the creator, then doth it returne to morning. And for the diſtinct daies, concerning the workes of God, he applyeth them likewiſe to the orderly and perfect knowledge of things produced:<note place="margin">The diſtinction of the daies infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the workes of God.</note> ſaying thus, [When the minde ſtayeth in the knowledge of it ſelfe, then is there one day: when in the acknowledgement of the firmament, which betwixt the water beneath and aboue, is called the heauen; then is the ſecond day: if concerning the earth, the ſea, and all things fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, which keepe themſelues in the rootes of the earth; there is the third day: and when it ſtayeth in the acknowledgement of the lights, both the greater and leſſer, and of the ſtars; there is the fourth day: if of the creatures which liue in the waters; there is the fift day: if of terrene things, and man himſelfe; there is the ſixt day.] And thus doth this good father trauell to diſcouer the great myſteries cloſed &amp; concealed vnder the couert of <hi>Moſes</hi> words, which in the relation of his hiſtorie hee doth moſt vndoubtedly apply to the capacitie of the rude and common people, with whom he had to deale, deliuering to the wiſe and more learned enough wherewith to ſatisfie their mindes. But without farther diſputing about this preſent matter, wee may note, that in the creation of the light, wherewith the world was to be adorned, was the beginning of forme giuen to the matter of the world, and of the diſtinction of creatures. Yea in that the light did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the ſun &amp; moone, which were created but the fourth day; God would thereby teſtifie, that in his onely hand light is reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that he can conferre it vpon vs without any other meanes. For we are ſo enclined, as nothing more, to alligate the power of God to thoſe inſtruments and organes, wherewith he ſerueth himſelfe; becauſe that for as much as the ſun &amp; moone do miniſter light vnto vs, wee will willingly aſſigne to them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our fantaſie, ſuch vertue, that if the world were depriued of them, we might hope of nothing but darkenes. Wherefore the Lord in this order of the creation cauſeth vs to ſee the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and how it is in him, and by him, that the light ſubſiſteth.

And foraſmuch as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, beſides all things produced, but God, it is neceſſary, that in him ſhould conſiſt their number, waight and meaſure. In him then is the waight without waight, for by it the great worker is not poiſed, but remaineth ſtable, giuing all things the power to be mooued, and at laſt to repoſe themſelues. And in truth, this frame of the whole world duely proportioned, and balanced by waight, could not ſuſtaine it ſelfe, if it were not poiſed by the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and gouernour thereof; who likewiſe hath the meaſure, by which he moderateth and diſpoſeth all that is contayned therein, in well ordered iuſtice, according to the ſtate and proper end of euerie of his workes. And in him alſo are the numbers without number, becauſe that all things which are in him, are the ſame onely God. And as he is the true vnitie, he contayneth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all number, giuing all things the power to be numbred. For all multitude ariſeth from one, and nothing can be one, making with any others a multitude, if by the participation of the higheſt one it doth not obtaine the ſtate of vnitie. And to it alſo all things created (imitating the courſe of numbers, as the true patterne doth the originall, and the end of Gods works) endeuoure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, in ſuch ſort as they firſt proceeded.</p>
                  <p>We neede not doubt then, but that the conſideration of numbers doth therewith import much doctrine. Wherefore particularly reſpecting the diſtinction of the workes of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in ſixe daies (which is the ſubiect of our diſcourſe) wee will note how many haue acknowledged the number of ſixe to be full of deepe myſteries.<note place="margin">The number of ſixe full of deepe myſteries.</note> Firſt therfore Mathematicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s teach, that ſix is the firſt perfect nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, becauſe it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded of certaine parts perfectly added togither, as of one, two and three: for which cauſe it is called of the Pythagoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (Gamon) or the Marrying number, becauſe all the parts thereof ſet aſide doe make it vp. Moreouer ſome parts of it multiplied together, to produce it: as ſixe times one, three times two, two times three. In this conſiſteth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the number, which is accompliſhed by all his parts: and but few ſuch haue beene found out by Arithmeticians. For within the number of an hundred they haue obſerued but that of twentie eight, to which they haue attributed ſuch proprietie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8737:39"/>
it conſiſteth of fourteene, ſeuen, fower, two, and one: as within the number of tenne, there is but that of ſixe which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by all his parts. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> entreating of this number where he writeth vpon <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> ſaith, that it contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſacrament of creatures. And in truth there could not be inuented any number more proper for the making of the world, then this of ſixe, which conſiſteth of a double proportion that it doth next containe in it ſelfe: (to wit) of fower with two, which numbers added togither make ſixe: which can hardly be found in other numbers, but ſuch as are of the nature of ſixe: as the double, triple, quadruple, or ſquare thereof, and ſuch like. So then ſixe reſulteth of that double proportion which makes the diapaſon in Muſicke, which is the perfecteſt and moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire harmonie of all the concords. For which it ſeemeth that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> would applie it to Natiuities and to Mariages, and then it doth conſequently verie properly fitte the Creation of the world, wherein were celebrated the true nuptials, and coniunctions of all things. Likewiſe ſixe, the firſt perfect number cannot but aptly agree to God, the ſoueraigne and moſt perfect creator, or to his worke, wherein there is no defect:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 2.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he had finiſhed and accompliſhed his workes in ſixe daies, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, [Thus the heauens and the earth were fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and all the hoſt of them.] But if we will farther proceed in the conſideration of this number of ſixe: we ſhall ſee how by the triangled or three-ſquare figure thereof, it doth properly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the creation of the world. For the baſe or foundation is the number of three, the point a vnitie, and the number of two is the meane betweene both, as appeereth in this figure<figure>
                        <figDesc>pyramid of balls</figDesc>
                     </figure> Now euery worke proceedeth from the three perſons in the Godhead to the vnitie, from which the outward works (performed in time) are vnſeparable: they tend alſo to an end, to which all things addreſſe themſelues: and the paſſage to proceed thither, is the number of two, which we may properly attribute to the matter firſt created by God, to forme thereof all his workes. For the firſt beginning of the production and order of creatures was the matter, which in reſpect of number repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the nature of the binarie, and ſeemeth to be reduced to the vnity, by the forme, which beareth the ſhape of the ternary: ſo that on euery ſide of the premiſed figure of the number of ſixe, the ternarie tendeth to the vnitie by the binarie. And by this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8737:40"/>
conſideration we may make way to the moſt high contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the number of ſeauen,<note place="margin">Of the number of ſeuen and his excellencie.</note> attributed to the reſt of the Lord. For we make no doubt, that when we ſhall be all reduced to the vnitie, as we tooke our originall from it, then ſhall the reſt of the ſabbaoth enſue, that is figured by the ſeuenth day; wherein it is ſaid that God ceaſed from his workes: and which ſhutteth vp and cloſeth the courſe and circle of all daies. Now that this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeauen hath beene much reuerenced by men of ancient times, we haue many witneſſes. For the Iewes becauſe of the ſabbaoth (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth vpon <hi>Eſaie</hi>) did honour it much. And <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> and <hi>Macrobius,</hi> vpon the dreame of <hi>Scipio,</hi> do ſhew great myſteries out of this number of ſeauen, which they call full and perfect, and attribute great power to it, in the ſea, and amongſt men. And the Pythagorians (as ſaith <hi>Chalcidius</hi>) commended it for the beſt, moſt naturall, and moſt ſufficient number. Moreouer it is compoſed of three, which is the firſt vneeuen number, that cannot be diuided by any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (for vnitie is no number, though it giueth all numbers the power to be numbred) and of fowre, which is a full euen number, &amp; the firſt double number of all others. For this cauſe the number of ſeuen is oftentimes vſed for vniuerſall &amp; generall, and to ſignifie perfection.<note place="margin">

houſe it ſelfe, but ſomething elſe do make them ioyfull: and like as (the effect being ſignified by the efficient cauſe) an epiſtle is called ioyfull, to declare the pleaſure of thoſe, whom it deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by reading thereof. Likewiſe when the Scripture recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that God reſted, we muſt not take it childiſhly, as if he (who by an intelligible and eternall worde ſpake, and it was made) had trauailed in his worke: but vnderſtanding by this manner of ſpeech, that God ceaſed from all worke, becauſe he no more created any new kindes of creatures; we may conueniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his reſt, to the reſt of thoſe, whom hee himſelfe cauſeth to remaine in eternall reſt, after that he hath firſt drawne them to himſelfe by faith in this life. Whereas alſo the prophet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made mention in each of the ſixe precedent daies of the creation, of euening and morning, doth mention no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſeuenth day: it ſeemeth hee woulde ſignifie, that this Sabbaoth day was ordained to repreſent the great and laſt day of euerlaſting reſt, wherein there ſhould be no more anie ſuch diſtinction of euening and morning, nor of day and night, as now is: but altogither light, by which we ſhall contemplate God face to face in true and perfect felicitie, ſuch as eie hath neuer ſeene, eare neuer heard, nor euer hath entred into the hart of man. Which wee muſt doubtleſſe beleeue was figured to the Iewes by the reſt of the Sabbaoth commanded in the law: for theſe names (Reſt, and Sabbaoth) in the Hebrew toong full of myſteries, ſignifie both one thing. In which matter we may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note, how the ſacred hiſtorie declareth, that man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſixt day, which was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus haue we ſufficiently ſpoken of the ſubiect, which we firſt entreated of: for elſe if we ſhoulde fully proſecute the myſteries included in the hiſtorie of the creation of the worlde, we ſhould haue matter enough to make vp a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great volume.

                  <p>THe learned and venerable antiquitie figureth, and maketh the vniuerſall world (to be) one, and threefold, as ſignifying and repreſenting (though very farre off and much behinde) the omnipotent, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-one, moſt wiſe, and moſt good worker, by whom it hath been created,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 11. de prepar. Euangel. Plat in. Phedro. Of the three worlds.</note> formed and ordained. For there is the vppermoſt world of all, which Diuines name, the Angelicall, and philoſophers call the intellectuall world: which (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) was neuer yet ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently praiſed. Then is there the celeſtiall world, or that of the ſpheres, which ſucceedeth and is next the firſt: and the third and laſt is the elementarie world which we inhabite, vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauitie of the moone. Now as this is the world of darknes, ſo is the Angelicall world the world of light, and the world betwixt both is tempered with light and darknes. The elementarie world is deſigned to vs by the flowing waters, and inſtable ſubſtance: the Angelicall by fire, bicauſe of the ſhining of the light, and eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place: and the heauen of meane nature is called of the Hebrues by a name ſignifying the ſame to be compoſed of water and fire. In this lowe-world life and death ſtriue for the maiſterie, by a kinde of viciſſitude, change and rechange all things: but in the higheſt is eternall life and permanent operation: and in that of the ſpheres, is certaine aſſurance of life, but there is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of works and of places. The elementarie is built of the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſubſtance of bodies: the intellectuall of a nature more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and excellent: and the meane heauen is compounded of bodies (but incorruptible) and of a diſpoſition conuenient for the nature thereof. The third is mooued by the ſecond, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is gouerned by the firſt: and this remaineth ſtable in his worke fit for his owne nature, vnder the holy of holies, the Lord-God almightie, which was, which is, and which is to come. And it ſeemeth that our great prophet, of whom we haue learnt the creation of heauen and earth,<note place="margin">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8737:41"/>
couering, was open and expoſed to raine, ſnowes, windes, ſunne, heate and cold: and (which hath more reference to our elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie world) in this former part haunted not onely men both cleane and polluted, temporall and eccleſiaſticall, but alſo beaſts of all ſortes: and there was likewiſe, bicauſe of the ordinarie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and offerings, a perpetuall exchange of life and death. The two other parts of the tabernacle were cloſed on euery ſide; and defended from all outward iniurie: euen as neither the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall nor ſuperceleſtiall world can receiue dammage. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theſe two were honoured with the title of holy: yet ſo, that the moſt ſecret was named the holy of holies, and the other ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the holy or ſacred. So likewiſe the ſphericall world is holy, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it perſeuering in the order, which was appointed it by the ſoueraigne creator, hath in it no fault or crime: but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall is euen the moſt holy and moſt diuine, wherein the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules inceſſantly reſound this ſong. [Thou art woorthie,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apocal.</hi> 4.</note> O Lord, to receiue honour, and glorie, and power: for thou haſt created all things; and for thy wils ſake they are and haue been created.] But moreouer, if we conſider how the laſt part of the tabernacle was common to men and to beaſts: how the ſecond all ſhining with the ſplendor of the gold, was lighted with the candleſticke diuided into ſeuen lampes (which, as many Greeke, Latine and Hebrue interpreters will haue, doe ſignifie the ſeuen planets;) and how in the third the moſt holy were the winged Cherubins: ſhould we not ſay that theſe three partes manifeſt vnto our ſight three worlds? To wit, this which men and all kind of creatures frequent: the celeſtiall where the planets ſhine, and giue light: and the ſuperceleſtiall which is the dwelling and abode of the bleſſed Angels, the way to which hath been opened by the croſſe, and bloud-ſhed of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, true God and true man, as the vaile of the temple, by which the holy of holies, being a type of the angelicall world, was ſeparated from the other partes thereof, renting and tearing at the death of our Sauiour, was a certaine ſacrament to vs?<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus haue we many notable things concerning the diuiſion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8737:42"/>
of the vniuerſall world,<note place="margin">Why the triple is called one.</note> which we may alſo call [One,] not onely bicauſe the three worlds do proceed of one onely and ſelfe cauſe, and tend to the like end; or elſe bicauſe being duly tempered by numbers, they are ioined togither by an harmonious accord and affinitie of nature, and by ordinarie ſucceſſion of degrees: but alſo bicauſe that that which is in all the three is likewiſe compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in one of them, and that there is not one, wherein all things, which are in the other three, doe not remaine. It is moſt certaine, that that which remaineth in this lowe world, is in the vppermoſt of farre better ſtuffe: and that which is in thoſe aboue, is ſeene alſo in this of farre woorſe condition, and as it were of a baſtard and ſophiſticall nature. For here heate is an elementarie qualitie, in heauen it is an heating virtue; and in the Angelicall thoughts, an Idea and exemplarie forme. Or to ſhew this more cleerely; we haue with vs in this baſe world the fire, which is an element: the ſunne in heauen is a fire: in the ſuperceleſtiall region the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphicke, or burning intellect is another fire. But let vs note how much they differ: The element burneth; the celeſtiall fire quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, &amp; the ſuperceleſtiall is imbraced by loue. There is alſo here below water; and ſo there is another water aboue being motreſſe and miſtreſſe of this belowe, which is the moone, in the firſt circle of heauen; but the cherubin, or cleere-ſighted ſpirituall ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are the waters that flowe aboue the heauen. And as touching the diſagreeable condition among theſe three kindes of waters; the elementarie humour quencheth vitall heate: that of heauen nouriſheth it: and the ſuperceleſtiall hath an intellectuall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it. Furthermore in the firſt world, God the firſt vnitie ruleth ouer the nine hierarchies of Angels; like ſo many ſpheres, and remaining immooueable mooueth them al vnto him: In the celeſtiall and meane world the imperiall heauen commandeth likewiſe, as a captaine doth his bands, the nine celeſtiall ſpheres, in ſuch ſort, that though they be mooued by continual agitation, yet it remaineth ſtable by diuine power. So likewiſe is there in the elementarie world, after the firſt matter being the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof nine ſpheres, or circular reuolutions of corruptible formes: that is, three of things inanimate, which firſt are the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then their compounds, and thirdly the meanes betweene theſe two, truly mixed and compounded, but vnperfectly: and ſuch are the impreſſions which appeere in the aire. Then are there three reuolutions of vegetable nature, diſtinguiſhed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8737:42"/>
into three kindes, as of herbes, ſhrubs and wood of olde growth. And laſtly three other of the ſenſitiue ſoule, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imperfect (as the Zoophyta) or to ſpeake Engliſh [creatures of a middle condition betweene things ſenſitiue and plants:] or very perfect; but ſuch as are within the bounds of the fantaſie not reaſonable: and in the third place that which is found excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in beaſtes, being capable of mans teaching; a meane thing between man and beaſt, as the Zoophyta partaketh of the plant and animal. But it may be we haue ſaid more concerning theſe things then is requiſite for our purpoſe: I will onely therefore adde, that the mutual vicinity and communication of the worlds, which we haue here deſcribed, is alſo declared in holy writ. For it is written in the Pſalmes, [In wiſedome he made the heauens.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note>] And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, that he was rauiſhed into the third heauen, which afterwards he calleth Paradiſe.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>&amp;</hi> 104.</note> We read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the Angels of God are ſpirits, and his miniſters a flame of burning fire. And thence without doubt it commeth, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to diuine natures are attributed both celeſtiall and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall ſurnames: when as ſometimes they are figured by ſtarres:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apocal.</hi> 2. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 2. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 21.</note> ſometimes by wheeles and beaſts, and ſometimes by elements: as we ſometimes alſo appropriate diuine and celeſtiall names to terreſtriall natures. For euen as the three worlds being girt and buckled with the bands of concord doe by reciprocall liberalitie, interchange their natures; the like doe they alſo by their appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. And this is the principle from whence ſpringeth and groweth the diſcipline of allegoricall ſenſe.<note place="margin">The originall of allegoricall ſenſe.</note> For it is certaine that the ancient fathers could not conueniently haue repreſented one thing by other figures, but that they had firſt learned the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret amitie and affinitie of all nature. Otherwiſe there could be no reaſon, why they ſhould repreſent this thing by this forme, and that by that, rather then otherwiſe. But hauing the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the vniuerſall world, and of euery part thereof, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſpired with the ſame ſpirit, that not onely knoweth all things, but did alſo make all things: they haue oftentimes, and very fitly figured the natures of the one world, by that which they knew to be correſpondent thereto in the others. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame knowledge, and the grace of the ſame ſpirit is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for thoſe, who would vnderſtand, and directly interpret ſuch ſignifications and allegoricall meanings. Moreouer beſides theſe worlds, which we haue alſo diſtinguiſhed, there is alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

a fourth,<note place="margin">Of a fourth world.</note> wherein may likewiſe be found all that which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the others.

Likewiſe it is a common vſe in ſchooles to teach, that man is a little world, and that within him the bodie is compoſed of the elements, the reaſonable ſoule is celeſtiall, the vegetable power common to men and plants, the ſenſe common to brute beaſts, the reaſon participated to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: and finally the image of God is therein ſeene &amp; conſidered.

We will therefore leaue theſe things for curious heads to diſpute vpon. Yet will we hold our ſelues aſcertained of that, which the holy Scripture doth openly declare vnto vs, and which may beſt ſerue vs to our comfort, and for the confirmation of our faith: that is, That the Angels, Gods creatures, are diſpoſers and miniſters of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence towards vs: &amp; that ſuch kind of beleefe is a certaine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt Atheiſts, concerning the prouidence of God.<note place="margin">Of the bleſſed eſtate of the angels.</note> And for the bleſſed eſtate of theſe celeſtiall ſpirits, it is certaine, that for as much as they haue no whit ſwarued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the light, wherein God created them, they remaine in bleſſednes and felicitie: from which they ſhall neuer more fall. Now if we demaund what this (felicitie) is? Without doubt it is the viſion and contemplation of the glorie and Maieſtie of God, whoſe face (as we ſaid euen now) they alwaies behold, and to whom they giue praiſe without ceaſing; ſinging with a loude voice this ſong, as <hi>Eſay</hi> declareth,<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Againſt thoſe which deny that there are any angels.</note>I know well ſome men be ſo fantaſticall, that they make it a doubt whether there bee any angels or ſpirits. The Sadduces in times paſt held this opinion, that by the word Angel was ſignified nothing elſe, but the motion that God inſpireth into men, or the power, which he ſheweth in his works. But there are ſo many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scripture which contradict this madnes, and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both eccleſiaſticall and prophane are ſo repleniſhed with woonderfull actes of inuiſible ſpirits, as we daily ſee come to paſſe, that it is a wonder how ſuch ignorance could be in former ages,<note place="margin">Error of ſome Philoſophers.</note> and yet among many remaineth at this day. There haue alſo beene men of great authoritie, who diſcourſing according to the reaſons of Philoſophie, haue dared to affirme, that God the firſt father and author of all things did onely produce one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence or angell: becauſe, ſay they, being alwaies of one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hee cannot by any naturall reaſon produce diuers thinges. For this cauſe therefore they woulde limite the powerfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of God, to one onely intelligence: which being created of God, had recourſe to the firſt thought, whereof it produced the ſecond intelligence: and knowing it ſelfe, it ingendred the ſoule or moouer of the firſt ſphere; and this moouer knowing alſo his worke, it proceeded to produce another: &amp; ſo ſucceſſiuely the cauſe being varied in ſubſtance and operation, diuers effects were produced. Which obſcure opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue ſome colour, if the firſt and almightie creator were reſtrained to produce but one effect onely: too abſurd a thing to be imagined in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and author of the vniuers; ſeeing that not a particular, but an vniuerſall effect is anſwerable vnto him, to wit the world one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the entire eſtate of all things, as wee haue heeretofore ſufficiently declared. And ſo it followeth, that this vniuers, like a body entire in it ſelfe, and diuers in the members thereof, was engendred by one onely father and creator, and liues by one onely vniuerſall life. But we will combate againſt theſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, with more ſtrong weapons, maintaining againſt them according to the truth,<note place="margin">How God came to his worke.</note> that the ſoueraigne maker came to his worke without being tied by any naturall law, but free and franke in euery worke, as he pleaſeth, being abundantly full of all vertue, and of all manner of bountie and eſſentiall good will,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8737:45"/>
proceeded to his outward worke: as theſe things haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto vs in our precedent diſcourſe. But this by the way; albeit the maxime of the Peripateticks be, (though falſe) that the firſt cauſe worketh of neceſſitie, and that it is alwaies of one ſort, (which is moſt true;) yet doth it not therefore follow, that it ſhould produce but one effect: ſeeing that of the ſunne, which is euer the ſame, and of the earth, which being ſtable changeth not, are produced diuers effects, without any varietie comming to their nature, yea, and without any tilling of the ground. For herbes, flowers and rootes of diuers kindes do grow therein, and many other eſſences are therein produced by power of the ſunne. But if theſe Philoſophers tell me, that diuers effects ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere in theſe things, becauſe that other particular cauſes doe worke therein togither: they haue left the proofe of this point to their children, to wit, whether this varietie proceedeth from diuers cauſes, or elſe from the ſame ſunne, fruitfull and full of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to engender diuers things. Then with how much greater reaſon may the firſt, true and eternall ſonne do it, being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly full of all fruitfulnes, light and life?<note place="margin">How all things are in God.</note> For all things were and are in him, not as if they were ſeated in any locall place, but are lodged in his thought, from whence producing them he is called their father and creator. He onely free from the lawes of nature without any matter preſuppoſed produceth all things; yea and the matter it ſelfe altogither full of fertilitie. But the ſecond or naturall cauſe (as Philoſophers ſpeake) requireth the ſubiect and matter created by God, wherewith it worketh. And here doth that take place which the Prince of Peripatetickes ſaith, [That in common acceptation of the ſoule, it is conuenient that it be made of nothing,] and therefore alſo our Diuines affirme that the angels can create no nature at all, and that they are creators of things, no more then Gardiners of fruits. And therefore all thoſe, who haue receiued the light of the truth, confeſſe God alone to be father and author of all things contayned in heauen and in earth: whether ſpirituall or corporall; viſible or inuiſible natures. And let vs neuer thinke that in ſo great conſonancie of the Vniuers, there are many creators: nor that there is any more then one onely king and prince, nor many things that conſiſt of themſelues. For ſo ſhould there be confuſion and diſcordancie in this great world, and ſo conſequently eaſie diſſolution. Thus much haue we thought conuenient to be knowne, concerning
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8737:46"/>
the Intellectuall world, wherein hauing ſpoken of the bleſſed eſtate of thoſe angels, which are not fallen from God, my minde is, that we ſay ſomewhat concerning thoſe who are fallen from their firſt eſtate, which we call commonly Diuels or euill ſpirits.

                  <p>IF we here diſcourſe ſomewhat by numbers, we ſhall make more eaſie way to that, which we would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand concerning the diuels, yea concerning euery creature. I ſay then euery number after the vnitie, attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be a perfect and accompliſhed number within it ſelfe. Now the vnitie alone totally ſimple, doth not paſſe from it ſelfe, but therein remaineth in indiuiſible and ſolitarie ſimplicitie, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is moſt fully content with it ſelfe, not hauing neede of any thing, being full of his owne riches. But euery number being by nature a multitude, doth by the benefit of the vnitie become ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, bicauſe it is capable of ſimplicitie. And although euery num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the more it departeth from the vnitie, the more it falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great multitude, hauing in it ſelfe more diſagreeableneſſe, more parts and compoſition: yet is there no number how neere ſoeuer to the vnitie, being a multitude and made of vnities, that is one by nature,<note place="margin">An excellent theologicall conſideration by numbers.</note> but by compoſition. Now if we referre this to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine matters after the manner of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> we ſhall ſay thus: God alone, who proceedeth not from any thing, and from whom all things proceede is an entire, moſt ſimple and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiſible eſſence; and which deriueth all that he poſſeſſeth from himſelfe: and by what reaſon he ſubſiſteth, by the ſame reaſon he is wiſe, he is willing, he is good, and he is iuſt. And we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any eſſence, whereof he may conſiſt, but the ſame being which he is. But all other things are not the ſame eſſence, but are through him, and therefore an angell is not this vnitie; for ſo ſhould he be God: or elſe there ſhould be ſundry Gods, which may not be imagined. For what ſhould be one, but the vnitie alone? It reſteth then that the angell muſt be a number, which being ſo, on the other ſide it is one in multitude, as euery number commeth of the vnitie by compoſition, and euery number is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8737:46"/>
imperfect, bicauſe it is a multitude, that which is perfect being entirely one. So then the angell being a number, that is, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he is not the ſame being it ſelfe, but he is onely an eſſence, to whom the being arriueth by communication, to the end that he may ſubſiſt. Neither is he vnderſtanding it ſelfe, but ſo he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, as being by a ſpirituall nature capable of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Thoſe things that betoken imperfection, are incident to the angell, as he is a multitude, or creature. But all that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and of accompliſhed forme in him, is by reaſon of the vnitie, whereof it is compoſed, and which he receiueth, bicauſe that he is conioined with God (who is the ſimple vnitie) from whom all being, all life, and all perfection is deriued to the creature. And therefore the philoſophers, as alſo the wiſe Hebrues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Yea the impietie of our age hath paſſed farther: For there are many,<note place="margin">Againſt thoſe which denie that there be any diuels.</note> which will not beleeue that there is any God or diuell. And it is not long ſince, that certaine talke being mooued betweene a prelate of this kingdome, and certaine others (concerning the diuel) he bluſhed not to aske them if they had euer ſeene any one, who had ſold him ſpectacles, conſidering he muſt needes be very olde, ſince (they ſay) that he came firſt into the world.

For there was neuer any, I will not ſay Chriſtian, but Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke, nor Pagan, endued with any naturall knowledge and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of teaching, but hath ſpoken of diuels and euill ſpirits, and haue by many writings left to poſteritie infinite teſtimonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their nature and maruellous effects. Yea &amp; the doctrine of the Aſſyrians, Arabians, Egyptians, and Grecians confirmeth that, which our moſt diuine theologie teacheth vs, concerning the euill angels chaſed from the ſeruice of God. And amongſt others <hi>Pherecides</hi> the Syrian deſcribeth the fall of the diuels, and ſaith that <hi>Ophis</hi> which ſignifieth the diueliſh ſerpent, was captaine of the rebellious armie. <hi>Triſmeghistus</hi> alſo the glorie of the Egyptians hath touched the ſame fall. And <hi>Homer</hi> the moſt excellent Greeke Poet, and ſetter foorth of myſteries, ſingeth in his verſes the fall of the firſt rebell, vnder the name of <hi>Até</hi> goddeſſe of iniurie and wrong. The Theologie alſo of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians in imitation of the Hebrew, confirmeth the ſame. Yea the diuels themſelues haue oftentimes confeſſed their owne fall: as many writings teſtifie, and they know, who haue trauelled in the ſearching out of ancient monuments. Wherefore this matter needeth not long diſputing, and it is not our intent to ſatisfie the curious and fantaſticall of our age, to whom nothing is pleaſant, ſaue new doctrine.<note place="margin">Creation, and fall of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and the cauſe of them.</note> But purſuing the Chriſtian truth, we ſay that ſince the angels haue beene created of God, and the diuels haue beene all created angels, there is no doubt, but they are his creatures, but not of the firſt condition, wherein they were at the beginning. For they were created good like the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and like man; but they haue made themſelues euill by their rebellion, pride and ſinne (like as our firſt father fell from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue integritie by imitation of them) ſo that of angels they haue made themſelues diuels.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.</note> And therefore it is written of them, that they haue not perſeuered in the truth, that is, that they haue not for euer ſtucke to God, who is the onely good of euery reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or intellectuall creature,<note place="margin">Lib. 12. de ciuit Dei cap. 1.</note> as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth learnedly teach: adding moreouer the cauſe of their fall, when hee ſaith, that the creature which may attaine to the gift of bleſſednes, can not do it of it ſelfe, becauſe it is created of nothing: but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth this benefite from him, by whom it hath beene created. Thereupon is concluded,<note place="margin">Sweete Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine to acknowledge all our good of God.</note> that immutable good is no other thing but the true bleſſed God: and that yet all things which hee hath created are very excellent good, bicauſe they proceed from him:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8737:47"/>
but yet they are mutable, bicauſe they haue beene made not of him (that is of his owne ſubſtance) but of nothing. Becauſe then the diuels haue beene created by God, we muſt vnderſtand, that they haue not that malice, which now we ſay is their naturall eſtate, from their firſt creation, but forſomuch as they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued themſelues. For that which is damnable in them, they haue gotten it ſince they turned voluntarily from God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.</note> And therefore it is ſaide that Sathan ſpeaketh of his owne when hee ſpeaketh a lie; becauſe he abode not in the truth: Whereby it appeereth that he was once in it.

                     </note> Wherfore as the diuels haue declined from their firſt eſtate, God hath not ſpared them, but hath bound them in the deepe with chaines of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to reſerue them to the iudgement of the great day, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perſeuering in their firſt malice and enuie, haue alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored &amp; ſhal continue to the end, to be inſtruments of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto men. And therefore all that, which the holy ſcripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs concerning them, tendeth to this point, that we ſhould ſtande vpon our guards, to reſiſt their temptations, and not to be ſurpriſed by their ambuſhments, arming vs to this effect, with all the armour of God, as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doth thereto exhort vs.<note place="margin">

And thence ſpring the idolatries of the Pagans and inuocations on diuels, which haue cauſed ſo many euils to lay holde on man. For the purpoſe of the diuels hath alwaies beene to make themſelues to be ſerued and honored of men, to the ende that being aſſociated with them, they might likewiſe be a moſt prouoking and effectuall cauſe of the iudgement of God.</p>
                  <p>And yet how many doe we ſee euen at this day,<note place="margin">Againſt thoſe that ſeeke after diuels.</note> who make boaſts to haue at their commaund ſuch miniſters of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whom they thinke to diſguiſe when they call them by the name of familiar ſpirits?

For they cannot behold the euents of the eternall and immutable decrees of God, which flouriſh in his diuine wiſedome, by ſuch a direct inſight as it hath beene giuen to the holy angels: and they ſee not the thing (if we may terme it ſo) to which are faſtened all cauſes, and whereupon they turne; neither do they know the fountaine out of which they ſpring: wherefore it commeth to paſſe, that as all things, which are not collected and concluded by their certaine principles, but by erring and eſtranged coniectures may deceiue; ſo the diuels are oftentimes beguiled in thoſe ſignes, whereupon they relie, and tell lies euen then, when they thinke themſelues moſt aſſured to ſpeake truth. But they alwaies tend to this point bicauſe of their malignant &amp; enuious nature, to bring all hurt to men, which in the end they cannot auoide, when they forget themſelues ſo farre, as that they will (againſt the word of God) take counſell of the diuell: an offence ſurely woorthie of all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Moreouer I doubt not, but as the pure and ſuperiour powers (whom according to the ſtile of holy writ, we call the good Angels, which is a word among the Greeks ſignifying Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger) doe not commonly ſuffer themſelues to be intreated by euery one, but doe require and attend the cleannes of hart, the holines of life, and the commandement of God: ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

The world then,<note place="margin">What the world is.</note> which yeſterday we called the threefold-one being contemplated with one view, is the perfect and entire compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, and the true image and admirable workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Godhead. The greatnes whereof is incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet limited: being alſo adorned with all bodies, and kindes of creatures which are in nature. And the deſcription thereof is properly called Coſmographie, which doth compriſe in it the firſt part of Aſtronomie and Geographie, that is, the order and reaſon, as well of heauen as of the earth: vnder which we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all natures and eſſences in them contained. And for this cauſe it ſeemeth that God being father and author of all things, is oftentimes called in the ſcriptures, creator of heauen and earth. And as the Greekes did firſt call the heauen (Coſmos) bicauſe of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8737:49"/>
the ſurpaſſing beautie: ſo afterward the name of (Mundus) hath been attributed thereto, bicauſe of the perfect and moſt pure hiew and neatnes thereof. Againe, becauſe the world is a ſolide bodie, that is full of celeſtiall or elementarie ſubſtances; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of a round and orbicular forme, performing a circular motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without intermiſſion vpon his owne poles, &amp; round about the earth (as about the center thereof) it is called a Sphere.<note place="margin">What a ſphere is.</note> For a ſphere is a bodie contayned vnder one round ſuperficies, in the midſt whereof is a point, from which all lines that are drawne to the circumference are equall.<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the world.</note> But as we conſider the world in this ſphere, ſo muſt we alſo contemplate it in two diſtinct parts, which manifeſt themſelues by continuall experience and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon: to wit, the elementarie region, continually occupied in generation and corruption, in change and alteration of all things, as well liuing, as not liuing; and the celeſtiall part, being of inuariable ſubſtance and adorned with innumerable ſtars, as well fixed as wandring, which enuiron the ſaide elementarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion round about: ſo that the elements being diuerſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled, infuſed and proportioned are the materiall cauſe and nouriture of all things: and the heauenly part by the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by the motion and influence of the ſtars, is the formall cauſe of their figure, varietie and ſpecificall difference, and from it proceedeth their life. Now that we may entreat of this firſt part of the world, which we haue named in our firſt diuiſion of the Vniuers (the world of the ſpheres) we muſt note, that this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall region (which philoſophers call the fift eſſence, thereby meaning that it is of another, and more ſimple nature then the fower elements) is by them diuided into eight orbes and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular heauens, one ioyning to the other, and all concentricall, that is, hauing one common and ſelfe ſame center, to wit, that of all the world; and of theſe heauens the greateſt doth enuiron, and by a ſphericall order encloſe within it that which is next and leſſe then it ſelfe, being each diſcerned by the proper and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion of thoſe ſtars which they containe: all which moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do varie one from another. And theſe eight orbes or ſpheres are, the heauen of fixed ſtars, which keepe an vnchangeable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betweene themſelues, and for this cauſe it is called the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament: then follow the ſeuen planets, of which the ſunne and moone are properly called <hi>Luminaria</hi> or great lights.<note place="margin">Reaſon of the name of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</note> And for <hi>Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi> they are eſpecially
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8737:50"/>
named planets, that is wandring in their motions. Whereupon we may note in regard of their names, that Aſtrologians to the ende to make their doctrine to be more eaſily retayned, and for certaine good reſpect and ſecret reaſon, making themſelues like painters to inſtruct the ignorant, haue alſo named and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe ſtars by perſonages of diuers habits and countenances: as likewiſe they haue diſpoſed vnder diuers figures the twelue ſignes of the Zodiacke, which are certaine ſtars, appointing to one the faſhion of a ramme, to another of a bull, to another of two twinnes, and ſo of the reſt. So likewiſe they haue ſignified the images of heauen, which are out of the Zodiacke; one by a beare, another by an eagle, another by an harpe; this by a dog, and that by a dragon, and ſo of the reſt. To the ſunne it ſelfe they haue aſſigned a proper forme and figure, as alſo to the moone. And we ſee that painters haue alwaies made the picture of ſtars with fiue beames, to denote their twinckling light, though all of them do not gliſter ſo, but are of round faſhion, without points or corporall beames. But returne we to our matter concerning the heauens and celeſtiall ſpheres, and let vs ſpeake of their order and ſituation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the order, and ſcituation of the heauens.</note>The firmament, which is the eight heauen, as the higheſt and greateſt of all the reſt, and as the vttermoſt ornament and beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all the world, doth enuiron round about the heauen of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;</hi> that of <hi>Saturne,</hi> the heauen of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> that of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the heauen of <hi>Mars;</hi> and that of <hi>Mars</hi> the orbe of the Sunne, which poſſeſſeth the middle place among the ſeuen planets: then the heauen of the Sunne compaſſeth round about the heauen of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> that of <hi>Venus</hi> the heauen of <hi>Mercurie;</hi> and laſtly that of <hi>Mercurie,</hi> the heauen of the Moone, which is the leaſt &amp; loweſt of all the reſt, and placed next about the elementarie region. And this number and order of the heauens is commonly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all Aſtronomers and Philoſophers; and ſheweth it ſelfe to be ſuch both by naturall reaſons, and by Mathematicall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations. Moreouer, for ſo much as by the Aſtronomers ring and other inſtruments fitting for the demonſtration of this ſcience, one may perceiue that theſe eight ſpheres are diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated one from the other, certaine reaſon doth thereupon conclude,<note place="margin">Of the firſt moouer, which is the ninth heauen.</note> that beſide theſe there is a ninth, which is called the firſt moouer, which is the guide of the heauens, and which by his owne power and violence doth carrie away all the others with it,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8737:50"/>
being no whit gouerned by any lower circle, but onely by that intelligence which mooueth it, or elſe by the commandement of God, to whom all motion is drawen, as to the firſt moouer, to the end that the whole harmonie of heauen be not confuſed as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> in the ende of his Organon prooueth. True it is alſo, that ſome moderne Philoſophers doe place betweene the firmament and the firſt moouer a ninth ſphere,<note place="margin">Of the Chryſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin heauen.</note> which they cal the Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line heauen, for that ſome ſtars are not ſeene therein. And this is becauſe that they cannot perceiue, how there might be made in the eight ſphere, the motion called Trepidation or tottering of the fixed ſtars if there were not a ninth heauen encloſed within the firſt moouer. For it ſeemes not likely to them, that the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is turned with three motions, ſhould be ioyned to the firſt moouer which is carried with one onely courſe. For this eight ſphere hath one daily motion from the weſt to the eaſt vpon the poles of the Zodiack, which is the circle of the ſignes, vpon which (according to <hi>Ptolomie</hi>) in each hundred yeeres it ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth one degree; or elſe in ſixty yeers, as others hold; then hath it the foreſaid motion of Trepidation. Wherupon they conclude that there is a ninth heauen, that hath onely a two-fold motion, betwixt the ſtarrie heauen and the firſt moouer, which is onely turned with one motion; to the end that in good order all things may bee reduced to the firſt moouing. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his profound Philoſophie ſaith; it is neceſſary, that by moſt fit agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſent euery thing may be reduced to that, which is the cauſe thereof. But becauſe <hi>Ptolomy, Hermes, Aratus,</hi> and other ancients, moſt exquiſite beholders of the heauens and of their motions and aſpects, are contented with the number of nine ſpheres, many therefore reiect the opinion of thoſe which make ten: becauſe that nothing maketh for them but onely the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Trepidation, which, ſay they, may be well conſidered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt moouer, put for the ninth ſphere. Beſides which, our diuines do yet declare to be a tenth heauen, which they call Empyreall, vitall, flaming and diuine,<note place="margin">Of the tenth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreall heauen.</note> into which are receiued the ſoules of the bleſſed. And it ſeemeth that <hi>Plato</hi> and his Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks, eſpecially <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke of the world, doth conſent to them. But this heauen and throne of God, cannot properly be reckoned with the other nine. For they bee mooueable, but this is ſtable and immooueable, they be of one ſubſtance onely, and this of another. Wherefore we may aptly referre it to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8737:51"/>
Angelicall and intellectual world, whereof we diſcourſed yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. And if we may bee permitted againe to diſcourſe by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as we haue begun; it is certaine that as the number of ten retaineth a double nature, becauſe it doth partake with that number whereof it is the end, and with that other whereof it is the beginning: ſo the tenth in all the prime kindes of things doth conſiſt of double nature. For man, which is the tenth kinde of things ſubiect to corruption, &amp; at whom the other nine finiſh, is of a corruptible and incorruptible compoſition. So the nine heauens end at the imperiall heauen, which in that it is material, agreeth with them, but in dignitie of matter it doth participate with the ſuperceleſtiall throne. As likewiſe they that ſpeake of the nine orders of angels, ſay, that they end in Chriſt their king, who holdeth and embraceth in all perfection both the nature of angels, and alſo of God; to whom at laſt all things muſt be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as to him, of whom, from whom, and by whom all thinges conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Now that, which heere we ſpeake of the heauens, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be learned out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the prince of all Philoſophers, or rather of the creator of all things himſelfe, who hath ſpoken by the mouth of his prophet, as alſo by himſelfe. For after <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had praied the Eternall that he woulde be alwaies with him, and that he woulde by continuall oracles inſtruct him, as there ſhould be great need, that hee might rule ſuch a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that he might giue them the law; [I will be (ſaith he) with thee, and will dwell in the midſt of thee: And according to all thoſe things, which I ſhall ſhew thee, euen ſo ſhall you make the forme of the Tabernacle. They ſhall make an Arke of Shittim wood, whereof the height and the bredth ſhall be a cubite and an halfe.] Such as haue diligently interpreted this text, do amongſt other myſteries finde therein the nine heauens aptly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for a cubite is ſixe palmes, then a cubite and halfe hie and broad are nine palmes. And againe, when he commandeth that vpon the ſame arke he ſhoulde make a crowne of gold, which ſhould ſerue it for a couering, and which was of precious ſtuffe, farre aboue that of the arke of wood, they would thereby make vs vnderſtand, that the tenth heauen was figured. Which for that cauſe is not numbred commonly with the other nine, but is conſidered by our vnderſtanding to bee the beginning of an other combination and coupling. For ten as it doth accompliſh
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8737:51"/>
the other numbers, ſo is it the originall of the tens; ſo an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth finiſhing the tens, beginneth the hundreths: So this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of gold, otherwiſe called propitiatorie, crowning the arke, was beginning to a better thing; for vpon the ſame were placed the Cherubims, and there were obtained the mercifull and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable graces of God. In ſuch ſort likewiſe the imperiall heauen, though it accompliſheth and finiſheth the number of the nine heauens, yet is it the beginning of ſpirituall and diuine thinges, and retaineth an angelicall nature; yet ſo, that it is proportioned to the ſpheres, who are appointed to haue a place. Againe wee haue heeretofore heard in the generall diuiſion of the vniuers, how in the partition of the Tabernacle into three ſpeciall parts, was very aptly ſignified that of the world, being a threefold-one. How alſo by the ſeuen lampes of gold ordained to be ſet to the candleſticke in the arke, might fitly ſeeme to be repreſented the ſeuen planets ſhining in their ſpheres: as likewiſe by the body of the ſame candleſticke, out of the ſides whereof proceeded ſixe branches, to wit, three out of either ſide, might bee particularly denoted the ſun, which is placed in the midſt of the planets, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there be three on each part in round forme, which like cups or veſſels receiuing influences from aboue, do conferre them on things heere below, by which meanes ſundry flowers do ſpring vp. But becauſe it woulde be too tedious for vs to compare all that which belonged to the making of the arke with that which is taught vs concerning the ſpheres, wee will come to conclude that there be nine Heauens: to wit, the firſt mooueable, by which the ſupreme worker and firſt moouer of all, mooueth all things. Then is the ſtarrie heauen or firmament, by which the ſame crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor diſtributeth his power into innumerable inſtruments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch things as he executeth, eſpecially by meanes of the ſeuen planets, which haue euery one their heauen, according to the order heeretofore declared. And vpon which, (according to our yeſterdaies ſpeech) the Hebrew doctors, and many other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines do teach, that certaine ſpirits (which they call celeſtiall, or ſeparated intelligences) do make abode, who being before the throne of God, reioicing in his preſence, do behold in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance as in a mirrour, all things which may be contemplated, and at the very becke of the prince of nature, do put his will in execution, vſing the heauens as inſtruments by which, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of diuers influences proceeding from all

the ſtarres and ſignes, heere below are produced with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, mettals, ſtones, plants, and liuing creatures. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we more amplie touch theſe things, which reſpect the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and admirable effects of the heauens in al creatures, we muſt firſt entreat of their figure and motion, which (AMANA) ſhall be the ſubiect of your diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>THat the heauen is generally and particularly of circular forme, and altogether round; the Latin name (Orbis) by which the ancients haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called it,<note place="margin">That heauen is of round forme.</note> is a ſure teſtimonie vnto vs. So likewiſe there are many naturall reaſons, which declare it to be ſuch. For all the partes of the frame thereof doe conſiſt of themſelues, doe ſuſtaine themſelues, and doe comprehend themſelues, not hauing neede of any ſtay or ioint, hauing neither a beginning nor ending place. Moreouer this roundnes of heauen may be knowne by the ſight of the eie. For on which ſide ſoeuer you behold it, you may ſee the halfe in our hemiſphere, as it doth ſhew it ſelfe: which could not come to paſſe in any other figure, but in a round; which alſo is the moſt perfect, and moſt capable of all other figures to bee compriſed in one ſelfeſame circuit: and is therewithall the eaſieſt to mooue euery way. And therefore it is not onely conuenient, but alſo neceſſarie for all the heauens and celeſtiall orbes, of which we before intreated, as well bicauſe of the perfection of their eſſence, as by reaſon of their proper motions, which are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and correſpondent to a round forme, &amp; beſides all this, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe ſpheres are placed one within another, making their reuolutions vpon diuers poles, and in diuers ſpaces of time. Which could not be obſerued, nor the integritie of the whole heauen maintained, if the celeſtiall forme were any other ſaue round and circular.<note place="margin">Of the proper and naturall motion of the ſpheres.</note> For the proper and naturall motion of the ſpheres is circular, that is, framed equally diſtant round about their center, which is the point in the midſt of the world, ſo that neither the whole heauen, nor any of the particular ſpheres, doth wholy abandon or paſſe out of his owne place and ſituation, but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8737:52"/>
onely the partes of them doe inceſſantly change place, in that they turne about their ſaid common center. And therefore is this circular motion much more noble and perfect, then that which is made by a right line, either mounting from the center of the world towards the circumference,<note place="margin">Of the motion proper to the fowre elements.</note> or elſe deſcending from it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the center: which motion is proper to the fower elements. For fire and aire do mount vpwards, but water and earth deſcend naturally downwards. Alſo fire mounteth higher then aire, and earth deſcendeth lower then water, and each of theſe enuiron the center of the world, which is the loweſt place of all, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from the circumference, which is the higheſt of all. So then the circular motion is naturally due and conuenient to the moſt noble and moſt ſimple bodie, which is the heauen, and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for it: as it appeereth more cleerely to vs by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion of the ſtarres, both fixed and wandring, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of the onely moouing of their ſpheres.<note place="margin">What ſtars are.</note> For we muſt note that the ſtarres are nothing elſe but certaine firme, cleere, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide partes of their heauens, made in round forme like the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whoſe motion they follow, which likewiſe receiue their light from the ſunne, who is the very ſource and fountaine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the ſoueraigne creator hath put the brightnes of the whole vniuerſall world.</p>
                  <p>Now this circular motion of heauen is found by obſeruation to haue two principall differences: that is to be made vpon ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry poles and axes, and in ſundry partes and poſitions of the world, as alſo in diuers ſpaces and quantities of times.<note place="margin">Of the axis of the ſpheres and of the poles.</note> [We call that the axis of the ſphere, which is the diameter that paſſeth through the ſame, vpon which it is turned, and the vttermoſt points of the ſame axis are the poles.] For the whole vniuerſall world hath his proper and naturall motion like a liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and euery of the orbes and particular heauens haue alſo a peculiar motion, like to the partes and members of the whole great bodie. For which cauſe, as alſo for diuers other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many learned perſonages haue affirmed, that the world is an animal or liuing creature. And amongſt others <hi>Origen</hi> is wholy of that minde, who enforceth himſelfe to prooue it, as well by reaſons, as by authoritie of holy ſcripture. And therefore he ſaith thus in his booke of principles. [Though the world be ordained to diuers offices, yet the eſtate thereof muſt not be thought to be diſſonant or any whit diſagreeing. But euen as our bodie alone
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8737:53"/>
is compoſed of many members,<note place="margin">Reaſons of ſuch as haue ſaid that the world is an animal.</note> and is contained by one ſoule; ſo I thinke we muſt ſuppoſe that the vniuerſall world is a great and vnmeaſurable animal, which as by a ſoule is ſuſtained by the power and wiſedome of God.] The Platoniſts doe all with one mouth teach the ſame thing. And among many reaſons, by which they would confirme this point, we will take onely that of <hi>Plato</hi> in his Timaeus, which, me thinkes, is moſt excellent. [There are (ſaith he) two motions, the one proper, the other ſtrange or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; now that is more diuine, which of it ſelfe is mooued, then that which is ſtirred by the power of another. And this motion proper and diuine is in our ſoules onely, from which the beginning of the other ſtrange motion is taken. Seeing therefore that all motion proceedeth of the ardor of the world, and that this ardor is not mooued by exterior agitation, but of it owne accord, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarie, that there muſt be a ſoule. Whereupon we gather that the world is an animal, and that not without vnderſtanding.] Now if thereupon any aske why heauen changeth not, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth diſeaſed, nor dieth, nor faileth as other liuing creatures doe? The anſwere of <hi>Chalcidius</hi> in this point pleaſeth me very much,<note place="margin">Notable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the workes of God.</note> when he ſaith, commenting vpon Timaeus, [That which is inſtituted by God without meanes, is free and exempt from change, from age, from ſicknes, from oldnes, and from death.] And in this point agree all Academicks: as alſo might bee well proued by circumſtance, if that be well conſidered, which the ſage philoſopher <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth to haue beene produced by the creator, without helpe or matter, and that which hath beene alſo performed by meanes of the ſecond cauſes. For though man was created and formed by the handes of God, yet was hee not made without duſt or earth, which was a meane ſubiect. But the Eternall hath made the heauens, and the whole frame of the world of nothing: For which reaſon it might ſeeme perpetuall, and not periſhing. For as we haue heretofore declared; though the heauens and earth muſt paſſe away, yet doth not this plainly conclude an annihilating of them, but rather a changing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.</note> For ſo ſpeaketh the kingly prophet, ſaying, [The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens ſhall waxe old as doth a garment, as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed.] And of this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may frame an excellent reaſon concerning the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the ſoule, bicauſe it was made without any meanes by God himſelfe. But leauing this argument, let vs purſue that,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8737:53"/>
which we began to ſay concerning the principall differences of the circular motion of the heauens.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the firſt and vniuerſall motion of all the ſpherick world, is that, which we ſee is made round about the earth,<note place="margin">Of the firſt, and vniuerſall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heauen.</note> from the eaſt by ſouth towards the weſt, alwaies with one and the ſame orderly celeritie and ſwiftnes, and without any ceaſing, which performeth his courſe in a naturall day, which is diuided into fower and twenty equall howers, as is plainly ſhewed vnto vs by the ordinarie courſe of the ſunne. So that the whole heauen, and each of thoſe celeſtiall ſpheres, doe followe the ſaide daily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it be not proper to them but accidentall, in that they are the parts of the vniuerſal world. For (as we ſhal preſently ſee) euery ſphere hath an other proper and particular motion. But this ſame, whereof we ſpeake, doth in ſuch ſort by accident agree with all the parts of the world, that the moſt thinne and ſubtile elements, eſpecially fire, and the ſuperior region of the aire, are in like ſort caried away therewith. So likewiſe doth the ſea, though it enuironeth not the earth round about, in ſome ſort follow this motion by ebbing and flowing euery naturall day, not performing an entire reuolution. Wherefore nothing but the earth remaineth vnmooueable, bicauſe of the waight, and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible quantitie of it in reſpect of the whole world, as being the center thereof. The ſtableneſſe whereof is very neceſſarie, that ſo both the vniuerſall and each particular motion may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for otherwiſe there ſhould be a confuſion in ſtead of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. And for this cauſe many haue ſuppoſed, that this whole Vniuers generally conſidered, is the firſt &amp; very true moouer of the vniuerſall motion, and not any heauen or particular orb. Now for the ſecond kinde of circular motions,<note place="margin">Of the ſecond kinde of circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motions.</note> it is that which is proper to euery of the eight ſpheres and celeſtiall orbs, which are the parts of the whole heauen, from the firmament to the ſphere of the moone. For each of theſe ſpheres (as is euidently percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the ſtarres enchaſed therein, which can haue no motion but according to their heauen) performeth his owne naturall and peculiar motion, contrarie to the firſt, and vpon other poles and axes, to wit, from the weſt by ſouth towards the eaſt. And the entire reuolutions of thoſe ſpheres, are done and finiſhed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſpaces of time, to wit, of the greater &amp; ſuperior more late, &amp; of the leſſe and inferior (being next to the elements) more ſoone. For the heauen of fixed ſtars, according to the moſt likely opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8737:54"/>
and apparent obſeruation of Aſtronomers, performeth his owne reuolution in thirtie ſixe thouſand common yeeres, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out biſſext, whereof each containeth 365. naturall daies: <hi>Saturne</hi> the higheſt planet, in thirtie yeeres; <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which hath his circle much lower, in twelue: <hi>Mars</hi> in two; the Sunne in 365. naturall daies, &amp; almoſt one fourth part of a day, which make vp the time and ſpace of a yeere. For one ſhall alwaies finde, that number of daies being runne out, the ſhadow of the ſunne to be ſuch, as (if you marke it) was the yeere before, at the very ſame inſtant, yea to the difference ſcarce of a minute.<note place="margin">Of the biſſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile day, or leap yeere.</note> Whereby it commeth, that from fowre yeere to foure yeere, is reckoned a biſſextile day, which ſerueth to make the yeere anſwerable to the courſe of the ſunne. The reuolution of whom, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercurie</hi> do neere approch vnto: and for the Moone ſhe maketh hirs in ſeuen and twentie naturall daies, and almoſt one third part of a day: ſo that in ſo ſmall time ſhee maketh as much way in regard of vs, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> doth in thirtie yeeres: becauſe he is the fartheſt from, and ſhee the neereſt to the earth, which cauſeth her courſe to be ſhorter then any other planet.<note place="margin">Of diſtances betweene the ſpheres.</note> And this is the conſideration, which hath giuen occaſion to many to caſt the diſtances and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are betweene the ſpheres: ſaying, that there is nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene times ſo much diſtance betweene the Sunne and Moone, as is between the Moone and the earth, &amp; ſo of the reſt. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himſelfe,<note place="margin">Plinie in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall hiſtory lib. 2.</note> a man very ingenious, counted by his calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (as <hi>Plinie</hi> relateth) that there were 125000. ſtades or furlongs betweene the earth and the circle of the Moone: and that from the Moone to the Sunne there were the double of them; and betweene the ſunne and ſignes of the Zodiacke the triple. Now a ſtade (or furlong) was meaſured by the ancients to conſiſt of one hundred fiue and twentie common paces, or elſe of ſeuen hundreth and fiftie feete. But ſo certainly to determine of the dimenſions and diſtances betweene the ſpheres, ſhoulde (me thinketh) be too great an enterpriſe for the capacitie of our ſpirits. Yet may the curious by ſome infallible reaſon of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie, or rather by imagined coniectures reſolue vpon it. And to conclude our diſcourſe concerning the motions of heauen, we ſee that though by the rapiditie &amp; violence of the continuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt moouer, all the ſpheres are caried away with it, in the ſpace of fower and twentie howers from eaſt by ſouth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the weſt, returning by north, or midnight towards the

And beſides theſe principall differences of the circular motion of the heauens, all the planets haue other motions of farther conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which are called circuits of the great reuolution, and which doe concurre in the great yeere, which is taken for the time when all the planets ſhall fully finiſh their courſes togither. But we haue ſaid enough concerning this matter, conſidering the entent of our diſcourſe; wherefore we wil proſecute as briefly as we may the other particularities ſeruing for the knowledge of the ſpheres, euen ſo much as we ſhall hold needfull for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hiſtorie of heauen and earth.

                  <p>IN the ſphere of the world are two kinds of circles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, whereof ſome are named greater,<note place="margin">Of the greater and ſmaller circles of the ſphere.</note> and ſome leſſer circles. They which haue one ſelfe-ſame and common center with the whole heauen, are called greater circles, and are one equall to another, and do diuide the globe into two equall parts. But ſuch circles as haue their centers out of that of the ſphere, are called leſſer circles, of which thoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that haue their middle points alike diſtant from that of the whole heauen, are equall one to another: being by ſo much the ſmaller, by how much their center is farther from the center of the whole. And therefore they which haue their centers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally diſtant from that of the heauen, are vnequall, and that is greater then the reſt, whoſe middle point is neereſt to that of the ſphere: and conſequently the one is by ſo much the more vnequall to the other, by how much the center of the one is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8737:55"/>
diſtant from the center of the other. And it is to be noted that all circular motion of any heauen and planet whatſoeuer, muſt be conſidered and meaſured by meanes of a greater circle: to wit that, which is directly placed betweene the poles of the ſame motion, and is equally diſtant from the ſame: becauſe it is a circle of the greateſt circuite and ſwiftneſſe, that may be deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſame motion.<note place="margin">Some circles are mooueable and ſome are immooueable.</note> But wee muſt vnderſtand, that among all the circles, there is one part mooueable that is inceſſantly turning therewith, and the other fixt and immooueable, ſeruing for to diſcerne the better the accidents and effects of the ſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call motions and moouing circles. Firſt then to entreate of the mooueable circles, as likewiſe to proſecute that which wee haue heard in our precedent diſcourſe, that there be two principall motions of heauen, whereof one is of the vniuerſall world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his reuolution from the eaſt towards the weſt, and the other contrarie from weſt to eaſt, as is proper to the planets: we muſt imagine in the ſphere of the world two principall circles, to wit, the Equinoctiall or Equator ſeruing for the firſt of thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Zodiack or Ecliptick for the ſecond. The Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall then is a great circle,<note place="margin">Of the equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall circle.</note> diuiding the totall ſphere into two equall parts, being placed directly betweene the two poles of the world, and equally diſtant in all parts from them. By the which circle is meaſured and conſidered the prime and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall motion of the whole world: and conſequently the time, which is nothing elſe but the meaſure of the ſucceeding of the ſame motion, which is alwaies of one ſelfe-ſame courſe and quicknes, and whereof the ſaid circle is called the Equator. Vnder which the ſunne directly comming (which is twiſe euery yeere) the daies are of equall length with the nights throughout the whole world: for which cauſe likewiſe the ſame circle is called the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, that is the circle of equall nights. And the poles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are thoſe of the whole world; about which the vniuerſall and regular motion is made: whereof that which is in the north parts, is called by the ſame name,<note place="margin">Of the poles of the world.</note> either the pole Artick, north-pole, or ſeptentrionall, which is alwaies ſeene where we inhabite, and about which there is a certaine figure of ſeuen fixed ſtars, turning circularly, which is called the great Beare, or moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the Waine. And the other pole oppoſite to this is named the pole Antartick, ſouth-pole, or Meridionall being towards the ſouth, &amp; is alwaies hid from vs. For the ſecond great and principall circle
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8737:55"/>
among thoſe which are mooueable,<note place="margin">Of the zodiack.</note> it is nominated the Zodiack or Eclipticke, or elſe the oblique circle: and it is that, wherein the twelue ſignes are placed of diuers names and figures, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obliquely placed in reſpect of the Equinoctiall, and poles of the world: ſo that one halfe thereof extendeth towarde the north or pole artick, and the other moitie declineth toward the ſouth and pole antarticke. And this circle is the very path way of the ſunne and reſt of the planets, all which keepe their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar motion in the Zodiack, to the end to diſtribute their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and vertue vpon the earth, for the life and production of all things.

And thus the two Equinoctiall points, and the two Sunſteads diuide the Zodiack into fowre parts, anſwerable to the fowre ſeaſons of the yeere: which are the Spring, Sommer, Autumne,<note place="margin">Of the foure ſeaſons of the yeere.</note> and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Of which, the Spring time beginneth at that Equinoctiall point, from which the ſunne by his proper motion, commeth and enclineth towards the higheſt point called Verticall. Sommer beginneth at the Sunſtead next following. Autumne at the other Equinoctiall: and Winter at the ſecond ſunſtead; ſo that the ſaid Equinoctiall points are called by the names of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſeaſons. And becauſe that euery naturall action hath begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, middle, and end:<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the zodiack into twelue parts called ſignes.</note> therefore each of theſe ſaid quarters of the Zodiack is diuided into three equall parts, and ſo the whole Zodiack into twelue: which parts are named ſignes, becauſe they ſignifie, and deſigne the moſt notable and apparant mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of things heere belowe, being chiefly cauſed by the yeerely courſe of the Sunne along the Zodiack. Euery of the ſaid ſeaſons of the yeere is likewiſe diuided into three parts, and the whole yeere into twelue, called moneths, that is to ſay mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the time, wherein the ſun paſſeth the ſaid twelue ſignes.

And as the twelue moneths haue beene diuided ſome into thirty, and others into thirtie one naturall daies; euen ſo is euery ſigne parted into thirtie degrees, and the whole Zodiack into 360.

And therefore the twelue ſignes of the Zodiack are called by certaine proper names, extracted from the nature and propertie of things correſpondent with their ſaid effects.<note place="margin">Of the names of the twelue ſignes and the cauſes thereof.</note> The firſt ſigne is nominated (Aries) bicauſe that the Sunne then beginneth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to the higheſt point, and the heate thereof doth increaſe, which mixing with the humiditie that the precedent winter had brought in, maketh the temperature of the aire hot and moiſt, which agreeth with the nature of a ram. The ſecond ſigne is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (Taurus) bicauſe that when the ſunne is therein, the heate fortifieth it ſelfe, and conſumeth the moiſture, ſo that the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the aire tendeth ſomewhat to drineſſe, which ſeemeth very anſwerable to the nature of the bull, which is of greater power then that of ſheepe. The third ſigne is named (Gemini) bicauſe the Sunne being therein, hath his heat redoubled: and amongſt all kindes of beaſtes the males and females haue natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall copulation, two and two togither to ingender one like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to continue their kinde. The fourth ſigne is ſaid to be (Cancer) for euen as the crab goeth backward, ſo the ſunne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into this ſigne retireth backe towardes the Equinoctiall from whence he came, making his declinations contrarie to thoſe of Gemini. The fift ſigne is called (Leo) bicauſe the ſunne being therein, by the redoubling of his beames, the heate is ſtrong, and drineſſe great, euen as the lion is a puiſſant beaſt, of hot and drie nature. The ſixt ſigne is named (Virgo) for as the virgine is a weake creature, and of her ſelfe barren; ſo the ſunne being in this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8737:56"/>
ſigne the heate diminiſheth, and drineſſe ruleth; whereby the production of things ceaſeth, and the earth becommeth barren. The ſeuenth ſigne hath to name (Libra) bicauſe the diſpoſition of the aire is then in ballance betweene the waſted heate and new-begun coldnes, and bicauſe alſo the ſunne being in this ſigne, the daies and nights are in ballance betweene the decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the one, and increaſing of the other. The eight is called (Scorpio) bicauſe that then the colde ruling with drineſſe are great enimies to nature, and doe corrupt the aire, which hath the proper qualitie of hot and moiſt: whereupon enſue plagues, and other dangerous diſeaſes, which ſurpriſe the creature, like the venome of a ſcorpion, which lies in his taile, and is engendred of corruption. The ninth ſigne is named (Sagittarius) for the ſunne being in it, the too much weakened heate is ſurmounted by cold, whereupon there enſue fogs and froſts, and other alterations of the aire, as hurtfull to creatures, as enuenomed arrowes. The tenth ſigne is nominated (Capricornus) bicauſe that the ſunne entring thereinto, is the fartheſt that all the yeere it can be from the verticall point; ſo that by rigour of the colde mixed with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which hath then full domination, as alſo by reaſon of the debilitie of heate, the diſpoſition of the aire is melancholie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the nature of a goate. The eleuenth ſigne is ſignified by (Aquarius) bicauſe then the drineſſe is ſurmounted by the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture now beginning, the cold neuertheleſſe remaining: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aire is cold and moiſt like water, and diſpoſed to ſnowes and raine. The twelfth and laſt ſigne is (Piſces) bicauſe as fiſhes are colde and moiſt, following naturally the water, hauing yet ſome little naturall heate: euen ſo is the temperature of the aire then cold and moiſt, hauing yet ſome heate growing by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of the ſunne to the vernall Equinoctiall point, ſo that the cold diminiſheth. And thus much concerning the ſignes of the Zodiacke, and the names to them aſcribed, for which cauſe the fixed ſtarres, which are in this circle and compriſed within the ſaid ſignes, both of the one ſide and on the other, haue been pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the faſhion of the ſaide beaſts: and their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence iudged from the cauſes by vs here declared; and not that the ſaid ſignes haue taken their names of the nature and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid ſtarres. And by this conſideration of the propertie of each ſigne in the Zodiacke, we learne, that by the introduction of one qualitie, enſueth the expulſion of the contrarie; and by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8737:57"/>
augmentation of the one, the decreaſe of the other. Which muſt onely be vnderſtood concerning the qualities happening in the aire, by the radiation of the ſunne onely, being ſtrong, meane, and weake, and the diſpoſition of inferiour things; without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing therein the other conſtellations and aſpects of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, changing &amp; greatly altering the ſaid diſpoſition of the aire: neither doe we touch the opinions of profeſſors of iudiciall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, who for other reaſons and principles of the ſaid arte, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the ſame ſignes other qualities then thoſe that we haue expreſſed.

                  <p>BEſides the two principall mooueable circles which haue beene declared vnto vs in the precedent ſpeech, there are alſo demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſphere two other great circles; whereof one paſſeth by the Equinoctiall points, and the other by the Solſtiſts or ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteads and poles of the Zodiacke, and both by the poles of the world, where they are diuided into three angles. And by this meanes they part as well the Equinoctiall as the Zodiacke into fower parts; the parts whereof anſwere togither in iuſt and equall proportion.<note place="margin">Of two circles called Colures.</note> Theſe two circles haue to name Colures, that is to ſay, vnperfect, becauſe they haue an vnperfect reuolution in turning with the ſphere vpon the points of their circumference, and not about their proper poles, like other circles. One of them then is called the Equinoctiall colure, and the other the Solſtitial colure. And the one paſſeth by the circle of the Zodiacke at the beginning of the ſignes Aries &amp; Libra, which are the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8737:57"/>
ſignes: and the other at the beginning of the ſignes Cancer and Capricorne, which are the Solſtitiall ſignes. And it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the arck of the Solſtitiall Colure compriſed betweene the Equinoctiall and one of the Solſtiſts, is the meaſure of the greateſt declination of the Sunne: which muſt of neceſſitie be equall to the arck of that Colure, which is betweene one of the poles of the world, and the next pole of the Zodiacke. For by how much one greater circle declineth from another, by ſo much the poles of the one are diſtant from the poles of the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all greater circles are equall, and haue one common center, and do equally part themſelues: and likewiſe their declination is iuſt in the midſt of their cuttings or interſections.</p>
                  <p>We muſt alſo conſider in the ſphere fower principall leſſer and mooueable circles; whereof the two firſt doe limit out the whole obliquenes of the Zodiacke, and the declination thereof from the Equinoctiall, as alſo the conuerſions of the Sunne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. And theſe circles are nominated Tropickes,<note place="margin">Of the two tropick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> that is, turning or conuertiue, becauſe they paſſe by the two Solſtiſts of the Zodiacke. That then which paſſeth by the firſt point of Cancer, which is the Sommer-Solſtice, is called the Tropicke of Cancer, or ſommer-Tropick: and that which paſſeth by the firſt point of Capricorne, or winter-ſolſtice, is named the winter-Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke, or Tropicke of Capricorne: being therefore one equall to another, becauſe they are equally diſtant from the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For the two other leſſer circles,<note place="margin">Of the two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary circles.</note> they are thoſe which be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed about the poles of the world, by the poles of the zodiack, limiting the deuiation or diſtance of the ſaid poles: and for this cauſe they are called polarie-circles, and do retaine the names of the Poles of the world. For one is named the North or Arcticke-circle, and the other the South or Antarcticke-circle, being alſo equall one to another by the ſame reaſon, as is vnderſtood of the Tropicks. And you muſt note that theſe ſaid fower leſſer circles do diuide the whole ſphere into fiue parts or principall regions, commonly called Zones: whereto as many parts, or diuers regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwere vpon the terreſtriall globe:<note place="margin">Of the fiue zones of the world.</note> which Zones are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as well in figure and greatnes, as alſo in nature or accidental diſpoſition, cauſed chiefly by the radiation of the ſunne. The firſt then of theſe fiue parts or regions of the ſphere is comprehended betweene the two Tropicks, &amp; diuided by the Equinoctial in the midſt; for which cauſe it is the moſt ample of all the reſt. The two
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8737:58"/>
extremeſt and ſmalleſt are compriſed about the poles of the world, within the Arcticke and Antarticke circles: wherefore the one is called the North, and the other the South Zone. And the other two are meanes betweene the greateſt, which is mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt; and the two extremeſt or leaſt, which are about the poles of the world, being larger towards the two Tropickes, then towards the polary circles, which togither are the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of them. And among theſe fiue Zones which enuiron the earth, ſome parts of them are become habitable,<note place="margin">Of the cauſes which make ſome parts of the earth habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and others not.</note> and others not, by meanes of the diuers effects cauſed by the ſunne. For the meane region about the equinoctial, is for three cauſes temperate. Firſt, becauſe the ſun being vnder, or about the ſaid Equinoctiall, it maketh a greater circuit in the Vniuerſall motion of the whole world, and runs faſter away; for which cauſe his heat maketh not ſo great impreſſion vpon the earth. Secondly, becauſe it paſſeth ſuddenly from the South to the North part, by reaſon of the tranſuers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Zodiacke about the Equinoctiall. And thirdly, becauſe the daies are there equall with the nights, whereby the heate of the one is tempered by the coldnes of the other. But about the Tropicks the heat is exceſſiue in Sommer. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſunne is then in thoſe ſtations, wherein his ſhining en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth longer vpon the earth, and by reaſon alſo that he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth leſſe compaſſe, and paſſeth ſlowly away, whereby his heat taketh more deepe impreſſion. And beſides all this, the daies are longer then the nights, in ſuch ſort that the heat of the one ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth the cold of the other. For the two polarie regions and the circumiacent parts, it is manifeſt that they are far out of the funs way; whereof enſueth, that by the too much oblique radia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, heat is there exceeding feeble, and cold great and intollerable. Finally, in the midſt or about the two other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide regions betweene the Equinoctiall and poles of the world, the diſpoſition of the aire is temperate; as well by reaſon of the commixture of the heate, which is about the Tropicks, and the cold which is about the polarie circles, as bicauſe of the meane radiation of the ſunne; that is to ſay, neither too direct, nor too oblique. So then the middle Zone, compriſed betweene the two Tropicks is temperate about the midſt, &amp; intemperate through exceſſiue heate, about the extremities thereof: whereupon it is in this part called the Torrid-zone, bicauſe the ſun doth alwaies turne about it. And the two polarie and extreme regions, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8737:58"/>
intemperate through colde. And the two meanes are temperate about the midſt; and in one extreme thereof intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with heate, and in the other with cold. But thereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not, that all intemperate places ſhould be inhabitable, but onely very hard, and difficult to dwell in.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto hath our talke been concerning the principall and mooueable circles of the ſphere:<note place="margin">Of immooueable circles, and firſt of the Horizon.</note> now let vs intreate of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooueable. Euen then as the Zodiack &amp; Equinoctiall are the two chiefeſt amongſt the mooueable circles: ſo are the Horizon and Meridian amongſt the immooueable. By the Horizon is meant a great circle imagined in heauen, which diuideth that halfe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen which is ſeene, from that halfe which is not ſeene: that is, which parteth the Hemiſphere vnder vs, from that which is aboue vs. And to this ſame circle one of the poles is alwaies the verticall point, and the other pole is the point oppoſite. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by how much each place hath his point higher, by ſo much doth the Horizon of each place differ; for there are ſo many Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizons as there be particular places. And therfore the Horizon of thoſe, which haue the verticall point (that is, the point which is right ouer head) vnder the Equinoctiall, is named the right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, bicauſe it muſt needes paſſe by the poles of the world, and diuideth the Equinoctiall at right angles one equall to another. Whereupon it is alſo called a right ſphere, bicauſe it ſeemeth to bee rightly placed in reſpect of that Horizon, and the ſtarres to make their motion directly by the vniuerſall motion of the ſphere. But the Horizon of thoſe whoſe zenith is out of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall towards the one or other pole of the world, is called ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, bicauſe that one of the poles (to wit, that which the verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call point is next to) is eleuated aboue the ſaid Horizon; and the other pole is ſo much depreſſed vnder the ſame: which for this occaſion doth diuide the Equinoctiall at oblique angles, vnequal one to another. Wherefore alſo the ſphere is ſaid to be oblique, bicauſe it is obliquely placed in reſpect of the ſaid Horizon: and the ſtarres turne obliquely in the vniuerſall motion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is euident, that all direct Horizons are of one ſelfeſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but amongſt the oblique, there are as many differences of obliquitie, as are diſtances betweene the verticall point and the Equinoctiall, or as the eleuation of the pole is diuers aboue them. For the Meridian, it is a great circle, which paſſeth by the poles of the world and that point of heauen, which is directly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8737:59"/>
ouer our heads, whereſoeuer we are: and diuideth both the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall and Horizon at right angles,<note place="margin">Of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian circle.</note> ſeparating alſo halfe the ſphere being eaſt, from the halfe that is weſt. The poles whereof are the interſections of the Horizon and of the Equinoctiall. And bicauſe it diuideth the naturall day, and the artificiall day (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we muſt hereafter intreate) into two euen parts, it is called the Meridian, or midday circle, which is as much to ſay, as the noone-tide circle. For when ſoeuer the ſunne is come from the eaſt to this circle, aboue the Horizon, it is high noone: when to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite point vnder the Horizon, it is midnight. All places then, according as they are more orientall, or more occidentall, haue their proper Meridian, and they which ly alike eaſt, or weſt, haue one ſelfe Meridian, though they be not alike diſtant from the Equinoctiall. And you muſt vnderſtand, that euery Meridian is a right Horizon to ſome, and euery right Horizon a Meridian.</p>
                  <p>Now do I next proceede to the other immooueable circles of the ſphere, without which, no man can vnderſtand the making and vſe of many inſtruments, eſpecially of the Aſtrolobe, which repreſenteth the ſphere reduced into a plaine forme. Of theſe circles, ſome are called verticall, ſome parallels of heights: then are there circles of howers, &amp; thoſe which diſtinguiſh the twelue houſes of heauen.<note place="margin">Of verticall circles.</note> The verticall are certaine great circles, which proceed from the vertical point (whereof they are named) aboue the Horizon, which they diuide into 360. degrees, and of the number of thoſe si the Meridian. But there is one eſpecially cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the verticall circle, which in the right ſphere is the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall it ſelfe, to wit, that which diuideth the Meridian at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and the Horizon alſo in the ſame points, where it is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Equinoctiall, which circle with the Meridian deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the fower principall angles of the world, that is, the exact points of Eaſt, Weſt, North and South, diuiding both the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon and vpper hemiſphere into fower parts, one equall to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the other verticall circles ſerue for to diſcerne in what quarter of the Horizon the ſtars riſe and ſet, or in what part of the ſuperior hemiſphere the ſame ſtars are eleuated aboue the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and how much they are diſtant from the Meridian, or from the foreſaid principall verticall circle.<note place="margin">Of parallel circles.</note> Now for the parallels of heights, they be circles being euery where alike diſtant one from another, diuided from the Horizon from degree to degree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the verticall-point; whereof the greateſt is next the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8737:59"/>
and the leaſt of all neereſt to the ſaid ſuperior point. Which parallels doe diuide euery quadrant of the foreſaid verticall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, comprehended betweene the verticall point and the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, into 90. degrees, and are alſo diuided by the ſame circles into 360. degrees. Moreouer they determine or diſtinguiſh the heights of the ſtarres, which are aboue the Horizon, as well in the eaſt, as in the ſouth and weſt. For by the height is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of euery ſtarre, you muſt vnderſtand the arch of the verticall circle, which paſſeth by the center thereof, compriſed betwixt the Horizon, and the parallell of the ſame, paſſing alſo by the ſame center. Whereupon enſueth, that in all verticall circles, which are equally diſtant from the Meridian, the ſtars haue equal heights, which commeth to paſſe in time equally diſtant, or rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned from noone-tide. And the greateſt altitude that any ſtarre may haue, is when it commeth vnder the Meridian circle, at what howerſoeuer it be. Now muſt we looke vpon the hower circles, and thoſe which diuide the twelue houſes of heauen: whereof ASER I impoſe the taske on you to diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>SIth that time is nothing elſe but the meaſure of the prime and regular motion of the whole world, as we haue heretofore declared, and that this motion is meaſured by the Equinoctiall, as out of our precedent ſpeech may be excerped: thereupon it is conſequent, that the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall is the meaſure of time, and that the entire reuolution of the ſame circle comprehendeth the naturall day: whereupon enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the diuiſion of the one muſt needes be anſwerable to the parting of the other.<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the Equinoctiall.</note> Now the Equinoctiall is diuided into twelue ſignes, and each ſigne into thirtie degrees, as is the Zodiacke. Therefore parting each ſigne into two halfes, the whole Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall ſhal be diuided into 24. equal portions, containing each 15. degrees: which are the meaſures of 24. ſuch howers of a naturall day. You muſt therefore imagine by the hower-circles, twelue greater circles (therein compriſing the Meridian) which paſſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8737:60"/>
through the poles of the world, and by the diſtinctions of the foreſaid fower and twentie parts of the Equinoctiall: ſo that each quarter thereof,<note place="margin">Of the hower circles.</note> comprehended betweene the Meridian and the Horizon, is diuided by the ſaid circles into ſix of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid parts, making togither the number of foure &amp; twenty hower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpaces, whereof the ſaide circles receiue their name. Amongſt which, that which diuideth the Meridian at right angles, paſſeth by the interſections of the Equinoctiall and Horizon; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the diſtinction of ſixe howers, both before and after noone. So that there is no greater circle which may bee deuided into fower and twentie equall parts by the hower-circles, but onelie the Equinoctiall, except it be conioined therewith. Wherefore as well the oblique Horizon, as the Verticall circle, which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Meridian at right angles, is diuided into fower &amp; twenty vnequall parts; which are ſo much the more one differing from the other, as the poles of the world are eleuated aboue, or vnder fiue and fortie degrees: and though theſe parts are vnequall, yet the ſpaces of the howers are equall in the ſaid circles, becauſe they proceed of the equall parts &amp; diuiſions of the Equinoctiall; yet ſo, that the ſaide equall ſpaces aſwell in the Horizon, as in the Verticall circle, which are equally diſtant from the Meridian, are equall, as well on the one ſide, as on the other: and are by ſo much greater the one then the other, by how much they are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtant from the ſame Meridian. Wherefore thoſe next to the interſections of the Horizon and the foreſaid vpper circle, are the greateſt of all: and in the ſame ſort are the fowre quarters of the ſaid circles diuided. It is to be noted, that euery right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon is ioined with the hower-circle of ſixe howers, without any diuiſion: and the Verticall circle ioined with the Equinoctiall is diuided equally as it is. But in the moſt oblique ſcituation of the ſphere, where one of the poles of the world is the ſuperior point, or Zenith, the Horizon is right with the Equinoctiall, and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded like it by the ſaid howerly circles, which are all of them then called Verticall circles.</p>

Firſt then is to be noted, that as the

ſunne and the reſt of the planets in performing their reuolution, by their proper and peculiar motion in the Zodiack, according to the radiation of the ſunne, being notably diuerſified from ſigne to ſigne, and according to the diſpoſition of elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſubſtances, do imprint their influence and vertue diuerſly, cauſing ſundry effects vpon the earth: ſo likewiſe theſe faire ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall lights being turned euery day about the earth, by the firſt and vniuerſall motion of the whole ſphere, do make the verie like mutation of their power and influence vpon the terreſtriall globe, by the variation of their ſhining; as may be marked from ſigne to ſigne, either mounting aboue, or deſcending vnder the Horizon.<note place="margin">Circles that deuide the twelue houſes of heauen.</note> For this cauſe you muſt diuide the entire ſphere of the world in regard of the Horizon being right, or oblique, into twelue equall parts or ſignes, which are called houſes, that is, notable manſions of heauen. Which is done by the proper Horizon and Meridian, with fowre other great circles and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Horizons, paſſing by the two interſections of the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Horizon and Meridian circle, and diuiding euery quarter of the principall Verticall circle (which maketh right angles with the ſaid Meridian) comprehended betweene the ſaid Meridian and the Horizon, into three ſignes, which amount togither to the number of twelue. And theſe houſes, or notable manſions of heauen begin at the eaſt ſide of the Horizon: and the firſt ſixe are diſtributed vnder it, and the other ſixe aboue it, according to the order of the twelue ſignes of the Zodiack and the proper motion of the planets, which is from the weſt, eaſtward. So that by the Horizon with the Meridian, the fower principall angles of the ſaide houſes are diſtinguiſhed: that is, the eaſt angle, which is named the Horoſcope, being the beginning of the firſt houſe; the weſt angle of the Horizon whereat beginneth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth houſe; and the midde heauen, which is the third angle, and there beginneth the tenth houſe; and for the fourth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle vnder earth, where beginneth the fourth houſe, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian:<note place="margin">Agreeablenes of the twelue houſes with the diuers ſeaſons of the yeere.</note> Euen ſo (as we haue heard) as the colures diſtinguiſh the two Equinoctiall points, and the two Solſtiſts or ſunſteads of the zodiack, which are the foure notable points therof agreeing with the fower angles aforeſaid. For the Horoſcope agreeth with the vernal Equinoctial point; mid-heauen with the ſommer Solſtice: the weſt angle with the Autumne Equinoctiall point: and the angle vnder the earth with the winter Solſtice: and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

the fowre quarters of the foreſaid Vertical circle are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to thoſe of the Zodiack, which make the fowre ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the yeere, and each whereof is diuided into three ſignes, as alſo euery quarter of the ſaid circle into three houſes equall to thoſe ſignes; ſo that the ſixe houſes, which are aboue the Horizon do accord with the ſixe ſeptentrionall ſignes of the Zodiack; and the ſixe other houſes with the ſouth or Meridionall ſignes. And theſe twelue houſes of heauen are called by diuers names; for thoſe fowre which begin at the fowre foreſaid angles, are named Angularie houſes: the next fowre following are called Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and the reſt Cadent. Moreouer we muſt note that in the right ſphere, each of theſe houſes comprehendeth one ſigne of the Equinoctiall; becauſe this circle is ioyned with the foreſaid Verticall: and all the circles which diſtinguiſh them paſſe by the poles of the world, becauſe they conſiſt in the foreſaid ſections of the Horizon and Meridian: which hath cauſed many to erre in this point, who would make the diſtinction of the ſaid houſes in the Equinoctiall, both in the oblique and in the right ſphere, lightly following the authoritie of <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> not noting how that author had the ſphere right to him: ſo that in that reſpect hee ſpake well, referring the manner how to diſtinguiſh the ſaide houſes in the oblique ſphere to the iudgement of all good Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers. Finally it is to be vnderſtood, that euery houſe is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into thirtie degrees, like the ſignes of the Zodiack, and that by other great circles, proceeding from the foreſaid interſections of the Meridian and Horizon. Moreouer you muſt note, that euery great circle which paſſeth by the ſaid interſections, and by the true place of any ſtarre, which is propoſed, is called the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon thereof: for all the foreſaid circles (as already hath beene declared) are but oblique Horizons except the Meridian, which repreſenteth the right Horizon. Then to erect the twelue hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of heauen, is nothing elſe but to finde the twelue princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall interſections of the Zodiack, and of the foreſaid circles; which is performed by the aſcenſions of the arcks of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack, aboue each of the ſaid circles (whereof we muſt preſently entreat) not regarding which arck of the ſaid Zodiack is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in each of the ſaid houſes.

Which conſideration is euery whit agreeable in each part of the Zodiack, or elſewhere. For the ſtars are in this place taken for points, howſoeuer they be of notable greatnes: wherefore it is neceſſarie that their aſcenſions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions ſhould be meaſured and diſcerned by the arcks of the Equinoctiall, hauing ſome conuenient beginning common to all Horizons, as the vernall Equinoctiall point is the beginning of the ſignes of the Zodiack.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8737:62"/>
and for that the Equinoctial is the meaſure of time, one may know at what hower and minute the ſtarre riſeth aboue the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, or deſcendeth vnder it, or attaineth to the Meridian cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, either aboue or vnder the earth, by the firſt and regular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole world.

                  <p>For the aſcenſions of the ſignes of the zodiack, very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be vnderſtood, for to meaſure and know the quantitie of the artificiall daies &amp; nights in all places of the earth, as hereafter we may declare: it is to be noted,<note place="margin">Of the aſcen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is to be noted, that that ſigne of the zodiack wherewith is eleuated one ſigne of the Equinoctiall preciſely, is ſaid to haue an equall aſcenſion: I omit heere to ſpecifie the accidents and differences of the aſcenſions and deſcenſions of the ſignes, which are particularly conſidered both in the right and in the oblique ſphere, &amp; which are common to the arcks of the zodiack, (which arcks are particles of the fower quarters of the ſaid zodiack, and do begin at the Equinoctiall points, and Solſtiſts:) for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is not particularly to diſcourſe of euery thing that Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers teach concerning the ſphere, and which cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but by demonſtration of the materiall ſphere, or by the figures placed in their bookes, which it is neceſſary to marke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to conceiue this part of the Mathematicks. But we will heere ſummarily and groſſely run ouer the moſt notable points required for our inſtruction in the vniuerſall deſcription of the whole world, and of the moſt noble things which come to paſſe heere below by reaſon of the prime and vniuerſall motion of heauen. Yet may we not ſteppe out of this matter without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the aſcenſions and diſcenſions of the ſunne, that is,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8737:63"/>
concerning euery degree of his way; which is the Zodiacke, the orientall and occidentall latitude of him; and which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth from degree to degree in the Zodiacke, either in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing aboue, or deſcending vnder the Horizon. But for the other planets or fixed ſtarres, no mention is made of them concerning this point.<note place="margin">Of the latitude of the ſunne.</note> It is then moſt manifeſt by that which we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die heard, that the interſections of the right or oblique Horizon, with the Equinoctiall &amp; verticall circle, which diuideth the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian at right angles, are in the midſt &amp; equally diſtant between the interſections of the ſaid Horizon, &amp; of the Meridian, and that they deſigne the points of the true eaſt &amp; weſt. And bicauſe that the Zodiack declineth from the Equinoctiall partly towards the pole arctick, and partly towards the antartick: the ſun doth not riſe in the true point of eaſt, nor ſet in the direct point of weſt, but when it is vpon the Equinoctiall points, which are the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections of the Zodiacke and Equinoctial. For while the ſunne is in the north part of the Zodiacke, he riſeth and ſetteth on the north ſide; and when he is in the ſouth part, he riſeth and ſetteth on the ſouth ſide: and that in diuers diſtances from the true eaſt and weſt, according as the true place of the ſunne declineth more or leſſe from the Equinoctiall. The arcke then of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, which is betweene the true eaſt and the center of the bodie of the ſunne, when it is come to the eaſterne part of the Horizon, is called the orientall latitude of the ſunne, and that which is compriſed betweene the direct weſt, and that ſame center when it is in the weſt part of the Horizon, is called the occidentall lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſunne. As alſo the latitude of the ſtarres is taken from the Zodiacke, towards the one or other pole thereof. For all ſtars both fixed and wandring, hold their longitude and latitude of the Zodiacke, as of the Equinoctiall their declinations, aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſcenſions. So that the latitude of the ſunne both ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall and occidentall, is neceſſarily northerly one halfe of the yeere, and the other halfe it is ſoutherly. And likewiſe the orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall latitude is equall to the occidentall in one day. And bicauſe the variation of each latitude proceedeth of the diuerſitie of the ſunnes declinations, they are therefore ſuch on the ſeptentrionall part, as on the meridionall. Conſequently you muſt note; that in the right ſphere, the foreſaid orientall or occidentall latitude, is ſuch without difference, as is the declination of the ſunne: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the right Horizon paſſeth by the poles of the world, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8737:63"/>
ſheweth both the one and other. But in the oblique ſphere thoſe latitudes are greater, then the declinations of the ſunne: and ſo much the greater and more different, as the pole of the world is eleuated aboue the oblique Horizon, and the place of the ſunne declineth from the Equinoctiall. So that the greateſt are thoſe of the ſolſtiſts, which doe moſt decline from the Equinoctiall: and beſides theſe, there are fower points in the Zodiacke, which haue equall latitude both orientall and occidentall; that is, two on the north ſide, and two on the ſouth ſide. But thus much may ſuffice concerning this matter, for our purpoſe. And that we may not ſwerue from the ſubſtance of our former diſcourſe, it will be good for vs to intreate of the daies, both naturall and artificiall, which are cauſed by the prime and regular motion of the whole ſphere, with the nights likewiſe, as you (ARAM) can manifeſt vnto vs.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt the moſt excellent and note-woorthie things, which depend vpon the firſt and vniuerſal motion of the whole heauen, and vpon that which hath been expounded in our forepaſſed talke; there appeereth next to be handled the vnderſtanding of the greatnes and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the daies, and the partes of them, called howers; as alſo of the heights of the ſunne aboue the Horizon, and of the ſhadowes as well right as oblique. Beginning then with the daies, you muſt note, that ſome are called naturall, ſome artificiall daies, which with vs are named properly daies, though indeede they be but parts of naturall daies, and ſo of nights.<note place="margin">Of naturall daies.</note> Now the naturall day is nothing but the time of the entire reuolution of the bodie of the ſunne about the world, made by the naturall and proper motion of the vniuerſall ſphere: which reuolution muſt alwaies begin at the Meridian circle, and comprehend the time, which is from one noone till the next enſuing. But bicauſe the ſunne this while go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth contrarie in his owne peculiar courſe; the point of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, which is vnder the Meridian with the ſunne, performeth his reuolution ſooner then the ſunne it ſelfe. Wherefore you muſt adde to the entire reuolution of the Equinoctiall, the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8737:64"/>
being taken in the right ſphere, from the part of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke, which the ſunne hath paſſed that while, to haue the entire reuolution of the ſunne, and the true meaſure of the naturall day. For all accidents of aſcenſions, which happen in the right Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, are common to euery Meridian circle in the right or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſphere: whereupon enſueth, that the true naturall daies are vnequall one to another, both bicauſe of the proper motions of the ſunne, as alſo bicauſe of the ſaid aſcenſions taken in the right ſphere. For the ſunne by reaſon of the obliquenes of the Zodiacke declining on either ſide from the Equinoctiall (which onely is the meaſure of time) is irregular in his owne proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and performeth not euery naturall day a degree preciſely, but ſometimes a little more, ſometimes a little leſſe. And though it ſhould make a degree iuſt, yet would not the aſcenſion in the right ſphere be equall. For theſe cauſes then, the true naturall daies are vnequall. But this inequalitie is ſcarcely to be perceiued by vulgar iudgement and ſenſible obſeruation. Moreouer it is to be vnderſtood, that foraſmuch as the motions of the planets, and the middle coniunctions and oppoſitions of the ſunne &amp; moone, cannot bee reduced into tables nor calculated, but by equall daies, and euen reuolutions of times: there muſt be aſſumed for this cauſe, certaine naturall daies, one like alwaies to another, which are called middle, or meane daies, containing each the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire reuolution of 360. degrees of the Equinoctiall, and aboue that 59. minutes, and almoſt eight ſeconds of a degree: Which make vp the quantitie of the regular and middle motion of the ſunne, correſpondent to one of the ſaid euen and meane naturall daies, according to which daies the tables of the foreſaid motions are compoſed and calculated. And by this meanes the propoſed terme of an entire yeere is reduced into true natural daies: which of Aſtronomers is called the Equation of the daies.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of artificiall daies, and nights.</note>For the artificiall day; thereby is vnderſtood that part of the naturall day, which the ſunne maketh paſſing from the eaſt by ſouth to the weſt, through the proper and vniuerſall motion of the whole world: During which time, the ſunne illuminateth the ſuperior part of the Horizon; for which occaſion, the ſaid part of the naturall day is properly termed day. And that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thereof, being compriſed betweene the weſt to the eaſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the ſunne, is named night: during which time the ſhadow of the earth is aboue the ſaid Horizon in forme of a round Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8737:64"/>
which doth then depriue that ſuperior part of the light and ſhining of the ſunne, whereby the darknes is cauſed, which is called night. And alſo the two twylights, that is,<note place="margin">Of the twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</note> the cleereneſſe which we ſee before ſunne riſing, and after ſunne ſetting, are parts of the night. For the true artificiall day beginneth, when the ſunne is in the eaſt part of the Horizon; and endeth, when he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the weſt. And theſe daies and nights are called artificiall, bicauſe that according to the diuers and artificiall ſituation of the ſphere, and according to the true place of the ſunne in the zodiacke, they doe differ in quantitie one from another. To vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande which varietie you muſt knowe,<note place="margin">Of the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the daies and nights.</note> that in all artificiall daies, of what length ſoeuer they bee, there riſe aboue the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon ſixe ſignes of the zodiacke, beginning at the true place of the ſunne; and the other ſixe ſignes which begin at the oppoſite point do riſe in the night time: bicauſe that the zodiack and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon are great circles of the ſphere, which do alwaies diuide one another equally. And according as with the ſixe eleuated ſignes, by day or night, any part or quantitie of the Equinoctiall doth ariſe aboue the Horizon, either more or leſſe; by ſo much the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall daies and nights are of ſhorter or longer continuance: ſo that the aſcenſion of the eleuated ſignes by day, is the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the artificiall day, and the aſcenſion of the other eleuated ſignes by night is the meaſure thereof. Becauſe then, that in the right ſphere, togither with the moitie or one halfe of the zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, whereſoeuer it begin, the moity of the equinoctial doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely riſe aboue the Horizon; for this cauſe therefore the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall daies are equall to the nights in the ſaid right ſphere. So that all the reuolutions of naturall daies compriſed betweene the two Tropickes, are diuided by the right Horizon into two iuſt halfes, and at right angles like the Equinoctiall. But in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſphere the daies are neuer equall to the nights but twiſe a yeere, that is, when the ſunne is in the firſt point of the ſigne of Aries and of Libra: which points are for this reaſon called the two Equinoctiall points. For in the oblique ſphere, there are but the two halfes of the Zodiacke, compriſed betwixt the ſaide E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial points, which may haue equal aſcenſions; becauſe that the two Colures do neuer agree with the Horizon, which cannot diuide the zodiacke and Equinoctiall alſo into two equall parts togither, except in the ſame Equinoctiall points. Whereof the one is neuer with the Horizon without the other; becauſe the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8737:65"/>
ſaid greater circles, are in them diuided into two exact halfes. But out of theſe Equinoctiall points, while the ſunne is in that halfe of the zodiacke, that declineth from the Equinoctiall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pole, which is eleuated aboue the Horizon, that is, from the vernall-Equinoctiall-point, by the Sommer-Solſtiſt to the Autumne-Equinoctiall-point, the artificiall daies are longer then the nights. And during the time that the ſunne is in the other part of the ſaid zodiacke, which declineth towards the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Pole, which is depreſſed vnder the ſaid Horizon, the nights are longer then the daies: which inequalitie is ſo much the more, by how much the ſunne is neerer to the Solſtiſts, and the ſphere is more obliquely placed in reſpect of the Horizon. So that the artificiall daies encreaſe from the winter-Solſtiſt, by the Vernall-equinoctial-point to the ſommer Solſtiſt; &amp; do decreaſe from the ſame by the Autumne-Equinoctial-point, to the winter-Solſtiſt. I do not heere particularize the diuerſitie of daies, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe all the yeere long from degree to degree, being a thing little neceſſary for the ſubſtance of our diſcourſe, and which they may eaſily learne, that will ſtudie vpon the Aſtronomicall ſphere: But that we may finiſh this day without going from our ſphericall matter; let vs ſpeake ſomewhat concerning the howers of the day and heights of the ſunne, and of his ſhadowes; the declaration whereof I commit (ACHITOB) to you.</p>

Euen as then there are two principall and great circles in the ſphere, the zodiacke and the Equinoctiall: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are there two maner of howers: one ſort are equall and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, taken from the Equinoctiall, the other vnequall, temporall or artificiall deriued from the zodiacke.<note place="margin">Of equall howres.</note> Equall howers are ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time meaſured by the aſcenſion or reuolution of one halfe ſigne: that is, of 15. degrees of the Equinoctiall. For time muſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8737:65"/>
be diuided according to this circle, which is the meaſure thereof. And though the Equinoctiall be firſt diuided, as euerie other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, into twelue equall parts, called ſignes, and each of thoſe into thirtie degrees like the zodiacke: yet neuertheles, becauſe that each ſigne demaundeth more time to be eleuated aboue the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, then the facilitie of diſtinction and ſupputation of time requireth, therefore is euerie ſigne diuided into two equall parts. And ſo in the whole reuolution of the Equinoctiall are 24. halfe ſignes of 15. degrees a peece, which make the diſtinctions and meaſures of 24. howers, diuided by the hower-circles, whereof we haue heretofore ſpoken. Which howers we call equall, as wel by reaſon of the equalitie of the 24. halfe ſignes, as alſo becauſe that one requireth no more time to be eleuated aboue the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, then the other. And for that the Equinoctiall is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the regular and naturall motion of the whole world, and that euerie ſigne is meaſured naturally and commonly by the ſaid equall howers, they are therefore called naturall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon howers. We muſt know then, that the ſunne maketh his entire reuolution about the earth, betweene one noone and the next following, according to the naturall daies in 24. howers, and one fifteenth part of an hower: becauſe the ſame reuolution comprehendeth the whole Equinoctiall (which is the meaſure of 24. howers) and 59. minutes, and 8. ſeconds beſides, which are almoſt one degree, which is the fifteenth part of the meaſure of one equall hower.</p>
                  <p>Concerning vnequall howers,<note place="margin">Of vnequal howers.</note> they are referred to the zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke, being in number 24. that is, twelue of the artificiall day, and twelue of night. And the day-howers begin at ſunne-riſing, and thoſe of night at ſunne-ſet. And they be all vnequall one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby they haue their name. Which that we may well vnderſtand, we muſt note, that in all artificiall daies and nights, of what quantitie ſoeuer they be, there riſeth aboue the Horizon one halfe of the zodiacke, comprehending ſixe ſignes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in day at that degree, where the ſun is; and at night in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which is diametrally oppoſite: And thus there are eleuated by day twelue halfe ſignes, &amp; as many by night. And as one halfe ſigne of the Equinoctiall maketh the ſpace of an euen hower; ſo one halfe ſigne of the zodiacke maketh the ſpace of an vnequall hower. Whereby appeereth that in each day and night there are twelue vnequall howers in the day, and twelue in the night.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8737:66"/>
And that theſe howers muſt be vnequall one to another, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth in this, becauſe that the zodiacke, by reaſon of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquenes thereof, cannot be the meaſure of time, but the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall onely. Wherefore it is neceſſarie that the time of the ſaide howers ſhould be meaſured by the arcks of the Equinoctiall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcending aboue the Horizon, togither with euerie halfe ſigne of the zodiack contayning fifteene degrees. And for that the arcks of the zodiacke, which are equall, cannot haue equall aſcenſions, euen in the right ſphere: it is neceſſarie that the ſaid twelue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers both of day and night ſhould be vnequall one to another; and by ſo much the more vnequall, by how much more the Pole is eleuated aboue the Horizon, according to the diuerſitie of the artificiall daies and nights: whereof they likewiſe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led artificiall howers. They are alſo named Planetarie and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, for that they are taken in the way of the planets, which is the zodiacke; and alſo becauſe the ancients haue aſſigned the time of the ſeuen naturall daies of the weeke, to the domination of the ſeuen planets, attributed to the ſaid vnequall howers: and haue appointed to the ſaid naturall daies, the names of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets which raigne, the firſt vnequall hower of the artificiall day. But leauing this diſcourſe, we muſt now entreat of the altitudes of the ſunne, and of his ſhadowes, according as hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in our antecedent ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>That we may better then vnderſtand the reaſon of ſhadowes, we muſt firſt haue knowledge of the altitudes of the ſunne aboue the Horizon: bicauſe that the diuerſitie of ſhadowes proceedeth from the varietie of thoſe heights.<note place="margin">Of the heights of the ſunne.</note> Now by the height of the ſunne is vnderſtood the arck of the verticall circle, which paſſeth by the center of the bodie of the ſame ſunne, being compriſed betweene the ſame center and the Horizon, and diſtinguiſhed by the parallell of the ſame Horizon, which paſſeth togither with the ſame center, as heretofore hath been related. So that the height of the ſunne increaſeth from ſunne riſing till noone, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally decreaſeth from noone till ſunne ſet. So that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt altitude that the ſunne may haue in an artificiall day, is at the noone hower: wherefore it is called the Meridian altitude. Which ſurmounteth the height of the Equinoctiall in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſphere, by the quantitie of the declination of the ſunne, ſo long time as he is in that part of the zodiacke, inclining towards the pole, which is eleuated aboue the Horizon: and is leſſe then
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8737:66"/>
the height of the Equinoctiall, by the ſame quantitie, when the ſunne is in the other moitie of the zodiacke, which inclineth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the oppoſite pole. So that the leaſt altitude that the ſunne may haue, is vnder the winter ſolſtice, and the greateſt is when he is in the ſummer ſolſtice. But the ſunne being in the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall points, his Meridian altitude differeth not in the oblique ſphere, from the height of the Equinoctiall. Whereupon enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in all the degrees of the zodiacke, which are alike diſtant from the one or other ſolſtice, the ſunne hath one ſelfeſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian altitude. And thereupon enſueth, that in all howers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is before noone, and the other after, and equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from noone; as are ten a clocke in the morning, and two a clocke after noone, the ſunne hath one ſelfeſame altitude: which is the cauſe, that in all ſunne dials, being compoſed by helpe of the ſaid howers, as the old quadrants are, the hower-ſpaces ſerue indifferently as well for before, as after noone. And bicauſe that the altitudes of the ſunne varie according to the obliquenes of the ſphere, the ſaid ſunne dials cannot ſerue generally, but onely to that polarie eleuation, whereunto the altitudes of the ſunne haue been calculated. Concerning ſhadowes, they are made by meane of ſolid-darke bodies expoſed againſt the ſunne:<note place="margin">Of right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe ſhadowe.</note> And of thoſe ſome are called right ſhadowes, and ſome reuerſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. The right ſhadow is that which is cauſed by interpoſition of the ſhadowing bodie, rightly erected vpon the Horizon: and the reuerſe ſhadow is that, which proceedeth from euery ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing bodie, equally diſtant from the ſaid Horizon. So that the right ſhadow reacheth out at length vpon the Horizontall ſuperficies: and the reuerſe ſhadow is turned ouer perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aboue the ſaid Horizon. Whereby it is manifeſt, that right ſhadowes are infinite, and reuerſe none at all, either at ſunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or ſunne ſet. Againe right ſhadowes decreaſe by little and little from ſunne riſing till noone; and doe proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally increaſe from noone till ſunne ſet: to which the reuerſe ſhadowes are contrarie. So that the leaſt right ſhadow, and the greateſt reuerſe ſhadow that can be in any day whatſoeuer, is at noonetide. And you muſt note, that the ſunne being eleuated aboue the Horizon more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 45. degrees, euery ſhadowing body being directly erected vpon the ſaid Horizon, ſurmounteth his right ſhadow; but euery reuerſe ſhadow ſurpaſſeth his ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bodie which cauſeth it. And when the ſunne is raiſed leſſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8737:67"/>
then 45. degrees, the contrarie commeth; for the right ſhadow exceedeth his ſhadowing bodie, and the ſhadowing bodie ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth the reuerſe ſhadow. But if the ſunne be preciſely 45. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees high, then all ſhadowing bodies are equall to their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes both right and reuerſe. From which equalitie is extracted the Geometricall ſquare, which is ſet in quadrants, or vpon the backe of the aſtrolobe, by which are meaſured (by meanes of the ſhadowes, or viſuall lines, repreſenting the ſaide ſhadowes) all lengths, heights and depths, by reaſon that the two ſides of the ſaid ſquare, which meete at right angles in the center of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, repreſent two ſhadowes one equall to another. Yet Geographers doe commonly vſe but right Meridian ſhadowes, to know in what part of the world the regions of the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: and how farre they decline from the Equinoctiall: which ſhadowes doe varie leſſe about the Solſtiſts, then about the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall points, like to the altitudes of the ſunne. But wee haue ſaid enough concerning this matter: and to morrow we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute our firſt diſcourſe concerning the celeſtiall world, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of the ſubſtance and nature of heauen, and of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular effects of the ſphericall bodies in things here below, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you (ASER) ſhall begin to diſcourſe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing this day to intreate of the ſubſtance and nature of heauen, and of the particular effects of the ſphericall bodies in things here below; we ſhall make more eaſie entrance thereto, if we firſt begin with ſome briefe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning all eſſences. Firſt then will we propound this principle, that among all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in heauen and earth, ſome are ſpirituall, and the reſt corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. By the ſpirituall we meane thoſe that haue no bodie, and cannot be perceiued by corporall ſenſes (as are angels, or diuels, and the ſoules or ſpirites of men:) And by the corporall, wee meane all other creatures, that are viſible and ſenſible to the ſenſes of our bodies. Now of theſe, ſome are without life,<note place="margin">Diuiſion of all eſſences, or natures.</note> and the reſt liue. And amongſt thoſe which are without life, there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in two points: One is, in that ſome haue naturall motion, and the reſt haue not. And amongſt thoſe which haue this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome are mutable and corruptible, and ſubiect to change, and the reſt are immutable &amp; incorruptible, perſiſting alwaies in their eſtate, during the courſe of this world. Stones, mettals, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and ſuch like creatures, are of the number of thoſe that haue neither life, nor any naturall moouing whatſoeuer, but like the earth it ſelfe. The water, aire, winde, and fire are creatures, which though they haue not life, yet haue they moouing: but they are ſubiect vnto corruption, as are all other creatures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the elements, whether they retaine life, or not. For by reaſon that they are compounded of matters and contrarie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, they doe at length corrupt and are changed, not in regarde of their firſt nature and ſubſtance, which periſheth not,<note place="margin">Nothing peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth in regard of the matter.</note> though it change formes, but returneth alwaies into the ſame elements,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8737:68"/>
whereof euerie compound conſiſteth. And though ſtones and mettals be exceeding hard, yet are they not exempt from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but are conſumed by vſage, yea euen gold and ſiluer, which are the moſt precious mettals and of ſo excellent temper, that they reſiſt fire. But the celeſtiall bodies, whereof we entreat now, conſiſt of ſuch matter, nature and ſubſtance; that being in perpetuall motion, they euer perſeuere in their entire and firſt forme, not being ſubiect to any change in their bodies, nor any way conſuming, like to the other creatures, winch are vnder them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the matter or ſubſtance of heauen.</note>But what this matter or ſubſtance is, hath beene much diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on amongſt the moſt learned. For ſome Philoſophers haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the heauens, ſtarres, and planets which we behold, are compounded of the ſame elements, whereof all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are made; but yet of the moſt pure parts and portions of them: And render this reaſon (viz.) that they could not be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if they were not created of viſible matter. For none can make a viſible thing of an inuiſible. Whereupon they conclude, that there is in the compoſition of celeſtiall bodies ſome portion of earth and water which are viſible elements, and more water then earth, becauſe it is more pure and cleere then the earth is, and becauſe it hath motion. And in that they are moſt ſplendant, cleere and mooueable, they attribute the principall cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the nature of the aire and fire, and the moſt ſubtile parts of them, whereof (ſay they) they are ſingularly compoſed. But others hold, that the heauens conſiſt of another kinde of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then of the elements, which they name a fift-eſſence, of moſt rare and different ſubſtance from the elementarie, and much more excellent and noble. Others more cunning finde in the heauens diuers and vnequal ſubſtances. Whereto may ſeeme to accord that which <hi>Americus Veſpucius</hi> hath declared in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of his third Nauigation to the Indies, concerning the magnitude of the ſtars, making mention of three verie great ones, called (Caponi) which are not cleere. And many other authors haue noted diuerſitie of ſhining and cleerenes among the ſtars, and that ſome part of heauen is thicker then the reſt. But whatſoeuer may be ſubtilly inuented in this matter, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth verie well, that heat is the ſubſtance of celeſtiall bodies, which is inſeparable from brightnes,<note place="margin">Of heat, light and brightnes.</note> which is a ſimilitude and ſemblance of light, hauing the ſubſtance of it and of heat ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8737:68"/>
with it ſelfe, that it is almoſt nothing elſe. So that the light, brightnes &amp; heat may be taken for one ſelfe ſame ſubſtance and matter of heauen, and of all the ſpheres. Which we muſt moreouer note to be ſo eſtabliſhed and ordained by God, that the Sunne, Moone, and all the other ſtars and planets are no whit chaunged ſince the day of their creation, any more then their ſaid ſpheres: neither are they more wearied, worne,<note place="margin">Of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the heauens.</note> or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, for all the labour which they haue performed by the ſpace of ſo many yeeres, then they were the firſt day of their creation. For you muſt not holde it for a chaunge and alteration of their natures and qualities; in that according to their diuers courſes, the ſtars and planets are ſometimes far from, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neere to one another: and that they haue oppoſitions, coniunctions, and diuers and different reſpects, according to the varietie of their motions: nor yet for the eclipſes of the Sunne and Moone: For ſuch changes are not in their proper bodies, ſubſtance and qualitie, but onely in regard of vs, and our ſight.</p>
                  <p>But to this conſtancie, ſtablenes and continuance of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and the celeſtiall bodies, the words of the kingly Prophet in the Pſalmes may ſeeme to be repugnant,<note place="margin">

But thou art the ſame, and thy yeeres ſhall not faile.</hi>] Alſo it is written,<note place="margin">

All theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies yet, do not contradict that which we heretofore ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of the celeſtiall bodies. For we refer their ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and continuance to the courſe of all this great world, which God hath ordained and eſtabliſhed to endure, till the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ending thereof; in ſuch ſort, as he hath declared to vs in his word. Moreouer, it is one thing to ſpeake of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens comparing their nature with that of other viſible and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8737:69"/>
creatures; and another thing, when we compare them with the nature of God or of his word, as the holy Scripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly doth.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal</hi> 90.</note> For according to the doctrine thereof, a thouſand yeers are as one day before God: wherfore alſo this viſible frame, both celeſtiall &amp; terreſtrial, is nothing elſe, but as a veſture which weareth, waxeth old &amp; is clean done, after that it is worne al out. And ſith that both heauen and earth are created by the word of God;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> there is no doubt, but they ſhall faile rather then it. For it remayneth for euer like God, from whom it proceedeth from all eternitie. There is yet diuerſitie of opinions amongſt the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctors about the vnderſtanding of the holy Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter which we do now treat of. For ſome indeed ſay, that the heauens ſhall periſh with the reſt of the world; if it ſo pleaſe the creator, and if he will haue it ſo; conſidering that all creatures, both viſible and inuiſible receiue their eſſence and continuance, not from themſelues, but from God alone: Yet for all that do they not thinke that the heauens ſhall altogither faile, nor that God will haue it ſo. And others maintaine that though the heauens muſt paſſe and be diſſolued according to the word of God; that yet this defect ſhall not be an entire annihilating, but onely a certaine chaunge which ſhall come to them, by which they ſhall be renued in far more perfection. Whereto it ſeemeth that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> agreeth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> when he cleerly teſtifieth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all creatures ingenerall, that they are ſubiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becauſe of the ſinne of man: and for that cauſe they doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with great deſire for the reuelation and redemption of the children of God: becauſe they ſhal not be relieued nor deliuered from the ſeruitude of corruption, to be in the liberty of the glory of them, and reſtored to their integritie, till the day ordayned by the creator, for the acceptation of his into eternall felicitie. For thereupon enſueth, that the heauens and celeſtiall bodies ſigh and grone, attending togither with the other creatures, this bleſſed day to be chaunged, renued &amp; reſtored, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe teacheth in the place before cited. Yea &amp; ſome philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers accord with him concerning the diſſolution of the world by fire, but not concerning the cauſe thereof. For they refer it not to the ſinne of man, which hath infected the heauen, the earth, and all things contained therein; and put the world into diſorder and confuſion: but to the nature of fire, which at laſt conſumeth all, and whereof they giue a reaſon by naturall cauſes. There are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8737:69"/>
alſo ſome Aſtronomers, who affirme, that ſome change may bee perceiued in the ſpheres and heauenly bodies concerning their courſes and ordinarie motions, and that they are ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe which they haue had from the beginning: how they waxe weary, are worne, and become old in their function, like to other creatures: although this change doth much leſſe appeere in them, then in the other works of God: but wee will leaue this argument to the profeſſors of Aſtrologie. And let it ſuffice vs, for concluſion of this matter, to conſider what the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and continuance of men in this world may be, ſeeing that all other creatures muſt receiue a change, and haue an end, yea the very heauens themſelues. For what are all people in reſpect of this great Vniuers? And againe, what is euery one of them particularly, in compariſon of the generalitie of mankinde, and of all thoſe which haue already gone before vs? But let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to that which concerneth the heauens and ſphericall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, conſidering that which doth touch their motions, beſides that which hath beene already declared, which (AMANA) ſhall be the ſubiect for you to diſcourſe vpon.</p>

                  <p>EAre we enter into the declaration of the ſubiect, which is now propounded vnto vs to diſcourſe vpon concerning heauen, my deſire is, that wee may cal to our memorie that which we haue already heeretofore heard of the nature of the heauens, concerning the matter whereof they are compounded, and concerning their beautie, ſtabilitie, and continuance. For ſo ſhall wee reduce the end of our diſcourſe to that principall point, whereunto we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die from the beginning deſtinated it; that is, ſo much the better to acknowledge our God, and his prouidence, to the end to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him. I ſay then, that if we conſiderately meditate vpon the excellencie of the celeſtiall bodies, we ſhall therein finde a more expreſſe image of the eternitie and maieſtie of God, and of his diuine and immutable nature, then in any of all the other viſible creatures. Moreouer we may accept of them as a teſtimony and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8737:70"/>
example, not onely of the immortalitie which God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for mens ſoules, which are ſpirituall natures: but alſo of that which he hath promiſed our bodies after our reſurrection. For that hee can accompliſh his promiſe, we neither may nor muſt make doubt of, if we beleeue that he is almightie: No more muſt we make doubt of his will, ſith he hath declared it vnto vs in his word. If then he hath beene able to create the heauens, and the ſtars and planets, which in them are, like ſplendant precious ſtones enchaſed in rings, of a matter ſo firme and durable, that it remaineth incorruptible, and as it were immortall, whether it be taken from the fowre elements, or be of an other quint-eſſence, as we haue already heard: It ſhal be no leſſe eaſie for him to make our bodies incorruptible and immortall, hauing deliuered them from corruption and death, to which (through ſinne) they were ſubiect. Now let vs purſue that which particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the heauen in his motion, wherein wee haue notable ſignes of the glorie and bountie of our God.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Three ſorts of motion.</note>To vnderſtand then ſufficiently that which concerneth the preſent matter, we will firſt note, that there be three ſorts of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the whole world. For there is one which tendeth to the midſt and to the center of the Vniuers, which is in the earth the loweſt of elements: which motion for that it deſcendeth, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the moſt heauie elements, and to ſuch creatures as do moſt participate with them. Then is there another motion contrarie to the firſt, which alwaies tendeth from the midſt, and from belowe vpwards: and this is proper to the moſt light elements, and to thoſe natures which do neereſt approch vnto them, and which participate with their qualities more then the reſt. But the third kinde of motion is that, which neither mounteth nor deſcendeth either one way or other, but goeth round, euer tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about the midſt like a circle or a wheele. And this is that which is proper to heauen, and to the ſphericall bodies, being moſt certaine, diſpoſed, and compoſed by a moſt conſtant and firme order. For though that all the elements, and all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which haue motion, obſerue an order therein, yet is it more ſubiect to change, according as the inferior bodies are ſubiect to the ſuperior. But thoſe haue a more certaine courſe, becauſe they depend not vpon other bodies, which are aboue them, but immediately vpon God, without the meanes of any other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall nature. And therefore of all the motions, which are in all
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8737:70"/>
creatures, that of the heauen and heauenly bodies is chiefeſt and moſt excellent.<note place="margin">Of the motion of the ſpheres attributed to the angels.</note> For whereas ſome attribute the motions of the ſpheres to the angels, as if God vſed their miniſterie heerein (as we haue already declared) whether it be ſo or not, yet this is moſt certaine, that the heauens haue their motion immediately from God, ſeeing there are no corporall natures aboue them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be mooued. For the angels are certaine ſpirituall creatures, on whom if the omnipotent hath impoſed this charge, we muſt be content to leaue the vnderſtanding thereof to him alone, ſith it is ſo much hidden from man. Now in that the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall bodies, and the elements, and all creatures haue their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion, wherein they continue according to the firſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance eſtabliſhed in nature by the ſoueraigne creator thereof; we are much to admire both the cauſe and effects of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie. I intend heere to ſpeake of a neere cauſe, which is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret amitie ingraffed into euery creature toward his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For there is a loue,<note place="margin">Euery creature foloweth his owne nature.</note> an appetite or vniuerſall inclination in all creatures, which vrgeth and inciteth them to deſire and ſearch that which agreeth with their nature: ſo that there is none ſo inſenſible, which hath not in it ſelfe this amitie innate, which euer puſheth it to follow the nature thereof: and for this cauſe may we ſay, that all motions proceed from loue. And paſſing further, we may contemplate the loue of God, as the eternall ſource of amitie and inclination of all nature, and as the firſt cauſe of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and we ſhall ſay, that in the ſame loue, God louing himſelfe, proceeded to his worke, which hitherto we haue celebrated, and do now meane to proſecute. For ſith that God is the ſoueraigne good, &amp; that all goodnes is by nature louing, it cannot be but he muſt likewiſe loue himſelfe exceedingly, and conſequently loue all that which he iudgeth to be good, inſomuch as it proceedeth from him, who is the ſupreme good, and the limit of all goodnes. This loue then not being able to be idle,<note place="margin">The loue of God is the firſt of all motions.</note> nor yet the good which it loued, would manifeſt both the one and the other, firſt in the creation of the world; namely in that of man; and then againe in the reſtauration and reparation of his fall. So we learne, that the firſt motion, whereupon all the reſt depend, is the loue of God, which proceedeth from his bountie, which he would not keepe ſhut vp nor incloſed in himſelfe, but would manifeſt and communicate it with his creatures, whom he hath created, to the end that he might be glorified in them and by them. And as he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8737:71"/>
loueth them for his owne loues ſake, and for that they were his worke: ſo hath he ſet in them the ſeeds of loue, both towards him and towardes themſelues, according to the diuers nature, which he hath conferred vpon them. It is then this naturall loue, which conſtraineth them by a ſecret feeling of nature imprinted euen in thoſe eſſences, which haue neither reaſon nor vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to take delight in that, which is agreeable to their creator, and to follow his ordinance, tending all to him, and to that which he loueth, bicauſe it is good, and therefore good, being done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will; and bicauſe it pleaſeth him to iudge it and approoue it for ſuch. Whereupon we may conclude, that loue and amitie is the good, by which all creatures haue an accord and agreement, firſt with God their creator, and then one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that vpon the ſame cauſe their conſeruation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doth depend.<note place="margin">Of the vnion and accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene all creatures.</note> Wherefore loue muſt be the bond and vnion of all the world, which is an vniuerſall peace and concorde betweene God and all his creatures. For the diuine prouidence hath ſo diſpoſed all the order of them, that they be all conioined one with another, by ſuch loue and amitie, that euen they, which ſeeme to be cleane contrarie, are allied, reconciled and vnited togither by thoſe, which haue more correſpondencie betweene them. In ſuch ſort that we may therein behold, a very pleaſant and perfect harmonie, like as in muſicke; wherein although it ſeemeth that the notes, tunes, and ſounds be different one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet notwithſtanding, there is ſuch a moderation in them, that they yeeld togither a goodly concord and ſweete melodie, keeping their proportions, times and meaſures. As then by ſuch peace and concord the celeſtiall ſpheres follow the generall and common courſe of the firſt, higheſt, and greateſt of all, within which they are contained and incloſed; performing likewiſe each of them his particular courſe, without endommaging themſelues, as we haue heretofore made mention: ſo doe all the elements follow the heauen, and obſerue their order after it, euery one in their degree, from the higheſt to the loweſt, hauing their motions agreeable to their nature. And euen as liuing creatures haue their agreements and coniunctions one with another, euery one in his degree, according to the couenant and participation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they haue togither, and as they are either neere to, or farre off one from another: euen ſo is it in the agreement and conſent of nature, which is betweene the celeſtiall bodies and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8737:71"/>
elements, and all creatures compoſed of them. For this cauſe, as the angels retaine the firſt degree among liuing creatures, and then man the ſecond next them, by reaſon that in his nature he neereſt agreeth with the angels, and doth neereſt approch them: ſo doth the heauen and celeſtiall fires retaine the firſt degree among creatures, which are without ſoule and without life, in their proper and conuenient motions, according as we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared. And as man doth in ſome ſort hold the middle place betweene the angels and the moſt perfect beaſts; ſo doth fire betwixt the heauen and the aire: and as the aire doth keepe the middle place betwixt the fire and water; ſo the water is a meane betwixt the aire and the earth. But theſe things will claime a fitter place, when we come to intreate of the elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie world. Wherefore we will returne to that which onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the heauenly bodies: which forſomuch as we haue ſaide to be of the number of thoſe creatures which are without life, being contrarie to the opinion of the moſt famous philoſophers: my minde is, that we ſhould conſider neerer of this matter; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by the excellent politicall and militarie order, which is amongſt them, it ſeemeth that they are not altogither depriued of life, reaſon, and vnderſtanding: as (ARAM) we may learne of you.</p>

                  <p>THis being true, that all creatures haue a certaine motion agreeable to their nature, and a naturall loue which euer vrgeth them to ſeeke and purſue that, which is moſt naturall for them; as hath been already rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our antecedent ſpeech: it ſeemeth that this can hardly come to paſſe, but that there muſt be in them, ſome kinde of ſoule and life, yea euen in thoſe creatures, that are moſt inſenſible. And more I will ſay, that it is not onely to be preſumed, that they haue ſome kinde of life, but alſo a naturall vnderſtanding, which we may properly name inclination; ſith there is no eſſence but can follow his proper courſe and order in his owne nature and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8737:72"/>
motions. For the ſtones themſelues, and mettals by a kinde of ſoule and vegetatiue life, doe growe and increaſe in the earth: wherefore it ſeemeth that they are nouriſhed in the earth like to plants. Yet we muſt note, that to ſpeake properly, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoule nor life attributed vnto them.<note place="margin">Foure kinds of ſoule, and life.</note> For according to the common rule of the learned, there are but fower kindes of ſoules, &amp; of life: except by abuſe of the language this name life be taken generally for the eſtate of all creatures. But when it is taken in his proper ſignification, the ſoule and life is onely attributed to fower kindes of creatures:<note place="margin">A kinde of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nature betweene plants and beaſts.</note> that is, to herbes, trees, and plants, a nouriſhing or vegetatiue ſoule and life: to * ſenſitiue plants, as ſea-ſponges, oiſters, cockles, &amp;c. a ſenſitiue: to perfect beaſts a ſoule and life cogitatiue or knowing: and to men an intellectuall or reaſonable ſoule and life. Though therefore that ſtones and mettals doe increaſe and grow in the earth, yet this is done by addition of matter, which is conuerted into their nature, rather then by any nouriture which they draw from the earth, as plants doe. And therefore when we ſpeake properly of life, we muſt vnderſtand ſomething more, then that which we ſimply call [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.] And yet one may ſometimes ſignifie (the eſtate or being of any thing) by the name of life, taking the word generally, and not in his moſt proper ſignification: for the being of euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is like the life thereof; inſomuch as thereby it is conſerued in his proper eſtate.<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Vnderſtanding proper to men and angels onely.</note>Now let vs ſpeake of the naturall vnderſtanding, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be in all creatures. I know that to ſpeake properly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and reaſon cannot bee attributed but onely to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men. For though all creatures obſerue their order and courſe in their naturall motions: yet doe wee not conclude that they do this by vnderſtanding and reaſon, whereof they ſhoulde participate with men, but rather by a naturall inclination, which God hath beſtowed vpon them to guide and direct them ſo. Yet it ſeemeth, that there is great difference betweene the celeſtiall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8737:72"/>
bodies, concerning which we now diſcourſe, and the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are without life and vnderſtanding, conſidering their well ordred motions and incorruptible nature, as we haue heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſhewed. For this is the cauſe why many Philoſophers haue taught;<note place="margin">Opinions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers touching the life and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the celeſtiall bodies.</note> that the heauens retained ſome kinde of life and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: briefly, that the world was an animall or liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the reaſons heeretofore alleaged. And therefore ſome haue ſuppoſed, that the celeſtiall and luminary bodies did nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and preſerue themſelues by the moiſtnes and vapors, which they attracted and drew vp by their heate, out of the water and other elements. And for faculties of ſenſe and reaſon, they alſo conſidered the ſame to be in them; becauſe that they haue their courſe and motions ſo well ordred and comprehended one by another, that therein can be found no fault, diſorder, or confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which ſo excellent order could not bee kept nor maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (it ſeemed) amongſt them, without great reaſon, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and wiſedome, yea more great then is ſeene in all the men of the world togither. For although they were created parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of theſe graces and gifts; yet ſo farre are they from maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch an order amongſt them, as do the celeſtiall bodies; that contrariwiſe there is nothing but diſorder and confuſion in them, and in all their actions. For theſe reaſons therefore ſundry Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers haue concluded, that as there are animals or liuing creatures in the earth, in the waters, and in the aire, ſo likewiſe are there in heauen; and that the ſunne and moone &amp; the other planets and ſtars are celeſtiall animals, not onely liuing, but alſo participating of reaſon and vnderſtanding:<note place="margin">Of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent politicall and military order in the heauens.</note> yea ſome haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them celeſtiall intelligences. And in truth they which haue good skill in Aſtronomie do conſider how the Sunne, the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt excellent of the lights of heauen, poſſeſſeth the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle place among the ſeuen planets like the king and prince of them, and which hath about him the lords of his court. For on one ſide is Mars the warrior, which hath charge of armies; and on the other ſide Mercurie his Orator and ambaſſador. Then is there betwixt him and Mercurie the planet Venus, which is the day ſtarre, meſſenger of the morning, which alwaies attendeth on the ſunne, at his riſing and ſetting: for ſhe riſeth euery day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſetteth euery day after him; and vnder thoſe is the Moone. Theſe two planets ſeeme to be allowed him like miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his houſe, and huſwiues of the moſt moiſt natures. Then
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8737:73"/>
aboue Mars is the milde and benigne planet Iupiter, to the end to moderate the vehemencie and furie of him. And higher yet is Saturne, who is cold, ſlowe, and ſadde; wherefore he may the better temperate the heate of Mars, and ſerue the ſunne like a ſound and well ſtaied counſellor, neere about his prince. Then may be ſeene the high heauen, commonly called the firmament, which containeth all the reſt of the ſtars, vnder which the ſunne marcheth in his royall magnificence, accompanied (like a king) with his court and armie, all in gallant order. Is not this then a goodly policie, &amp; like a royall court, a celeſtiall common wealth, and a braue armie, wherein euery ſtar and planet keepeth his ranke and order? And not onely for theſe conſiderations, but euen by teſtimonies of Scripture, there are ſome will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prooue, that the celeſtiall bodies haue reaſon and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 1.</note> For the prophets, namely <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſay,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times addreſſing their ſpeech to the heauens, call them for audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: as when they ſay [Oh heauens, heauens, heare that which I ſhall ſpeake, and giue eare to my words] So that they woonder, why theſe holy men ſhould call to the heauens, if they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoule nor life,<note place="margin">

And the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in his canticles doth exhort the heauenly bodies to praiſe God no leſſe then the angels themſelues. But now let vs tell them, that if by theſe authorities we muſt conclude, that the ſpheres haue in them a ſoule, life, ſenſe, and reaſon: we might ſay the like of the aire, of the clouds, waters, fire, haile, ſnowe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, windes, yea and of all earthly creatures, to the very plants. For the roiall prophet inuiteth them all to praiſe the Lord, as well as the heauens. Yea he proceedeth farther, when he ſaith, that all of them performe the word of the Lord. And when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Iſay</hi> call the heauens to record, they do as much to the earth, as if it had eares to heare, &amp; vnderſtanding for to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.<note place="margin">Why the word of God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times directed to inſenſible creatures.</note> We muſt then know, that the prophets vſing this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech, doe ſpeake to inſenſible creatures, and which are without vnderſtanding, the better to mooue men to their dutie, and the more to induce them to acknowledge their ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and rebellion againſt God, by rendring to him that honour and reuerence, which they ſhould beare to his Maieſtie, which is of ſuch waight and vertue, that the very ſenſe and feeling thereof reacheth to all nature and to euerie kind of creature. Whereby me muſt learne, how great reproch ſhall redound to men, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8737:73"/>
the number of witneſſes that ſhal appeere againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they will be more deafe at the voice of God, then the deafeſt creatures, and if they will be leſſe mooued with his preſence, and hardlier acknowledge it, then thoſe his works which are fartheſt remote from reaſon vnderſtanding. And in truth what ſhame may this goodly order which we whilome ſpake of, to be amongſt the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies, euery day breed in vs? For if they had a ſoule, life, ſenſe, and vnderſtanding; wee might leſſe woonder to ſee them euer continue and maintaine ſuch a conſtituted order. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we might aſcribe the good gouernment of them to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and wiſedome, which might be reſident in them. But if they haue neither ſenſe nor vnderſtanding, by meanes whereof they might attaine to that intelligence &amp; wiſedome, for to know how to guide &amp; gouerne themſelues: ſo much more iuſt occaſion hath beene giuen to the prophets to appeale to them as witneſſes and iudges againſt men, and leaue to looke to other creatures, ſeeing that they ſhew in effect, that they do better vnderſtand the voice and word of God, whereby they haue beene created and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and which hath appointed and ordained the eſtate wherein they ſerue; then men do, whom he hath made partakers of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and vnderſtanding. Wherefore wee will heere note, that when the prophets do exhort the inſenſible creatures to praiſe God, it is chiefly for two reaſons. The firſt is, in keeping euerie one their order, they glorifie God after their faſhion, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their nature, becauſe they are like preachers of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance, wiſedome, and bountie, and as witneſſes of them, and of his glory towards men: and the other reaſon is ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to induce men to praiſe their creator, as it behooueth them. But for the Philoſophers, yea the Pythagorians &amp; Academicks, which proceed farther concerning the life, reaſon, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which they contemplate in the ſpheres, ſaying, that they are repleniſhed with ſoules lodged in them, and by which many of our Diuines alſo wil haue to be ment, the angels and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall ſpirits, who (ſay they) mooue the heauens: but what, and how many there are of theſe intellectuall formes in the ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall bodies, he onely knoweth,<note place="margin">

                  <p>SOme might maruel, why chriſtian philoſophers do alwaies (when they intreate of the ſphere) retaine the names of the gods and goddeſſes of the ancient idolaters; which the Pagan philoſophers, both Greekes and Latines, haue long agoe giuen to the ſtarres and planets.<note place="margin">In French the names of the daies are ſo, but in our toong not.</note> But this ſhould ſeeme no more ſtrange, then that we yet obſerue in the daies of the weeke the names, which were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to them by the ſaide authors, and which they haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken from the names of the planets, except ſunday. For, bicauſe that theſe celeſtiall bodies haue beene ſo called at the firſt by thoſe, who haue moſt curiouſly and diligently ſearched them out, and left precepts of the Aſtronomicall doctrine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe theſe fond names yet remaine amongſt vs, like many other things taken from the ancients. But the diſcourſe is very great and of deepe ſtudy, concerning the diuers properties, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and powers which Aſtronomers aſſigne to the planets, aboue all nature, yea and ouer all men: of whome making their predictions, they name one man a Saturniſt, another a Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, or Iouialiſt, or elſe a Mercurialiſt, or a Venerian, or a Phebae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,<note place="margin">Properties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed by Aſtrologers to planets.</note> or a Lunatiſt. In ſuch ſort, that the diuers affections, inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and manners of men, are by many holden, not to proceede onely of the matter diuerſly diſpoſed (as there be ſome that eſteeme:) but alſo by the diuers influence and ſundry forme, not in ſpecificall diuerſity, but particular and proper. And thence it commeth, that <hi>Ptolomie</hi> and other profeſſors of Aſtrology do teach, that the ſtars and planets do giue influence of good and of euill: for (ſay they) by <hi>Saturne</hi> is infuſed a firme and ſtable pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> a righteous iuſtice: by <hi>Mars,</hi> a conſtant force and puiſſance; by the Sunne, an ardent charity: by <hi>Venus,</hi> a milde hope: by <hi>Mercury,</hi> a penetrating faith: and by the Moone, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate temperance. Moreouer, that by <hi>Saturne,</hi> as by a moſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8737:74"/>
graue and ſublime fautor, men are induced to the moſt profound myſteries of all diuine and naturall Philoſophie: That by <hi>Iupiter</hi> they are gouerned in a good &amp; due temper, ſo that they make &amp; obſerue lawes, and diſpoſe all things with equitie, purſuing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies that which is righteous. That from <hi>Mars</hi> they receiue the abilitie and power to performe any exploit, to the end to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in their enterpriſes. That the ſunne beſtoweth vpon all, generation, operation, and life; as charitie (which is appropriated to him) adorneth all the vertues, like life, and forme. That <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> giueth grace, cheerefulnes, and loue; by which men being mooued do performe all high matters with delectation; becauſe we could not ſuſtaine the labour, which is in the ſtudie of naturall and diuine matters, no not in temporall things, if loue did not thereto inuite vs; wherewith being afterward recreated, we eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſuppreſſe the affliction which continuall thought in profound matters and of difficult vnderſtanding doth bring vnto vs. That <hi>Mercurie</hi> maketh vs prompt, ſharpe and ſubtile in euery buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but chiefly in ſearching out of the truth, and in obtaining eloquence, muſicke, and glory. That the Moone in the foreſaid effects of the other planets, giueth a more neere and variable motion; ſo that ſhe cauſeth to be correſpondent to man (as to the end and image of the whole Vniuers) all the loftie members of it. All theſe properties (I ſay) are attributed by ſundry Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers to the planets, in regard of the good which they cauſe to men. Againe, others acknowledge ſome of them to be the cauſe of many euils, and thoſe they call ill planets, not celeſtiall.

For the reſt, I paſſe them heere in ſilence, that I may not bee too tedious in this matter, which ſome Mathematicians and Poets aſcribe to other planets, making them cauſe of many other euils, according to the diuers conſtellations, where they doe contemplate them. But to ſpeake my minde, we like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt beleeue, and not thinke as many naturaliſts doe (who in ſtead of acknowledging a God, do forge to themſelues an Idoll of Nature, that it ſhould be the planets or ſtarres, who like foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines or Ladies of vertues, properties and powers, giue influence to men of the foreſaide qualities: but onely that in diſpoſing their bodies, being compounded of the elements, vpon which the planets worke, they ſerue to aide them to abound in vertues or vices, according as their minde beeing moderatrix of all their actions, doth diſpoſe hir faculties, to intend good or euill. For this cauſe we ſay, that to thoſe which want the gifts and graces of Gods ſpirit, all things cannot but ſucceed badly, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ſpheres hurt them rather then otherwiſe, yea ſome more then other ſome: as to the contrarie, the minde of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful well inſtructed doth correct the naughtines of the ſtars, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth himſelfe from all peruerſe inclination. This is it, that the thriſe great Philoſopher <hi>Mercurius</hi> ſaith, entreating of thoſe whom the diuine power, whatſoeuer it was, had forſaken, leauing and abandoning them to the euill (as hee ſpeaketh) and all that, which was ſenſible in them. For thus ſaith he. [Of ſuch the forces of anger &amp; appetite, which being wel directed would cauſe euery good worke, turne into a nature depriued of reaſon.] So then we learne, that very vaine is the faith that is giuen to the planets, to conſtellations, and to fooliſh diuinations and ſuperſtitious prognoſtications of Aſtrologians. For true Chriſtians feare not the ſignes of heauen, nor their aſpects and regards: but do whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend vpon the grace of God and of his prouidence, which turneth all to the good of his elect.</p>

had ſaid, that ſuch curious obſeruations full of ſuperſtitions, are friuolous and falſe; belonging to pagans and idolaters, and not to the people of God.

                        <hi>Eſay.</hi> 47.</note> namely in <hi>Iſay.</hi> For God, which is aboue all nature, hath meanes, which men cannot perfectly know, either by reaſon of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or for that thoſe meanes are ſupernaturall.

But I woulde willingly aske them, what foundation they can haue, when (like prophets) they enterpriſe to foretell men, good lucks and ill lucks, and all euents which they muſt expect, and chiefly to kings, princes, and other chiefe perſonages? For where doe they finde, when God created the ſtars and planets, that he gaue them commiſſion to reueale to Aſtrologers, what ſhould be the nature and complexion of euery one, according to the planet vnder which they ſhould be borne? And againe, how can ſuch iudiciall ſcience haue certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſeeing there are a thouſand men that are borne euery day in the world, in one ſelfeſame countrie, at one ſelfeſame time, hower and inſtant, one ſometimes to be a king, and another a poore ſhepherd, being neither like in nature, nor like in manners, but ſometimes more contrarie then fire and water? For this is much prooued in many twinnes, as the ſcripture giueth vs a notable example in <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> For they were borne ſo cloſe to one another,<note place="margin">

And by how much the one was humble, good and peaceable; by ſo much the other was proud, wicked and warlike. And who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God hath ſet marks in any of the ſignes of heauen, to ſignifie to men that, which he hath ordained concerning euery one in his eternall counſell, which is hidden from the angels themſelues? Surely whatſoeuer we can learne, is through his holy ſpirit, which he communicateth to ſuch as he pleaſeth, reuealing to them his ſecrets, as heretofore he did to his moſt faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. And therefore he that would haue moſt certaine progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtications, muſt not goe away to ſeeke and aske them of other more true Aſtrologians then the prophets and apoſtles, with their writings.

Now I could in this preſent matter, concerning the influence of celeſtiall bodies vpon men, produce the teſtimonies of the moſt renowmed amongſt the ancient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, againſt thoſe, who attribute ſo much vertue to the ſtarres: but bicauſe the authoritie of a Chriſtian is of no value with the Atheiſts and ſuperſtitious, which are willingly the greateſt idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of nature, I will bring them the proofe of ſtrangers, yea of thoſe, who firſt gaue the precepts of pronogſtications: by which they may eaſily finde their teachings thwarted by themſelues; and to haue beene left otherwiſe by them, then the troupe of their followers doe ſuppoſe. Let them reade the text of <hi>Ptolemie,</hi> prince of Aſtronomers,<note place="margin">Many things to be conſydered in horoſcopes.</note> in the beginning of his Apoteleſmes (which is as much to ſay, as the effects referred to the natiuitie-hower) there ſhall they ſee that he attributeth this to the ſtarres, that to the maner of the birth, ſomething to the ſeed of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, one thing to the diet, another to the place, &amp; another to the orders: So that very little reſteth in the planets. And the author concludeth his ſpeech in this ſort: [As we commend phiſitions, who ſearch out the originall of the diſeaſe, and the cauſes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers faſhions: ſo muſt not we be deſpiſed, if to iudge vpon the infant borne, we inquire of the region, of the birth, diet, manners, and other occurrences.] And in his booke entituled (Alarba) he ſaith, That oftentimes ſuch accidents meete in the infant borne, that he cannot receiue the celeſtiall influence, ſometimes very little, and ſometimes much, which many are ignorant of. How then can any by the ſtarres onely determine of that, which muſt happen to man from the hower of his birth, as infinite many doe beleeue? But bicauſe ſome, who are abuſed by this iudiciall ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doe willingly reply, that Aſtrologians &amp; prognoſticators do oft foretell many things, which are afterward found true: I deſire that we may examine their reaſon, which (ASER) I leaue to you to diſcouer.</p>

                  <p>WHo diligently ſhould marke in predictions &amp; aſtrological prognoſtications, the falſhoods and truthes which therein are found, I doubt not but he ſhould perceiue theſe much more rare, then the other. But people doe commonly take ſo great delight to be deceiued, that it ſufficeth them, if they be once told truth, for a thouſand times wherein they haue beene foretold lies. And God knoweth, how the profeſſors of this arte doe aduaunce that point as much as they can, and doe diſſemble in all others, whereby their leaſings may be diſcouered. And when they will moſt floute fooles, they vſe ambiguous and obſcure manners of ſpeech, like the anſweres, which long agoe the diuell made by oracles, both of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and other pagan-idols. For ſuch kinde of ſpeech is fit to ſtrike the ignorant in a dumpe: who though they vnderſtand not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticators ſpeech, yet according as things come to paſſe, they will expound them to their minde, and chiefly, when among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, ſome one doth ſtumble vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome like apparance with that prediction, although the aſtrologer ſpeakes at aduenture, and ſometimes vnderſtands not himſelfe: yet this is certaine, and is daily ſeene by experience, that indeede the moſt cunning in this ſcience foretell many things, which are after found true. And this may happen chiefly in three manners. The firſt is,<note place="margin">How aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell a truth.</note> when they containe themſelues within the bounds of Aſtrologie, and will prognoſticate nothing, but whereof they foreſee the cauſes moſt manifeſt in nature: as in eclipſes of the Sun &amp; moone, the changes thereof, in the courſes of the planets, their aſpects, and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch like naturall inclinations, the knowledge whereof they may by their arte attaine vnto. But when they paſſe farther, it happens to them which is ſometimes ſeene in bad archers and bowmen, who though they take their aime badly, neither yet draw right, may neuertheleſſe ſhoote ſo often, that by great chance, one or other may hit the white. But this comes not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8737:77"/>
for if one ſhould reckon the badde ſhoots, they would bee exceeding fewe that had hit in reſpect of the reſt. And in this ſort haue we in the beginning of our ſpeech ment, concerning the copious and ambigious manner of Aſtrologers writings and ſpeeches, very proper for their intention. Finally God in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and moſt iuſt iudgement, doth many times permit that the things foretold by ſuch deceiuers do oftentimes ſucceed, to the intent to puniſh the curioſitie and vanitie of men, as it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falleth out, and hath in old time beene knowne by the oracles of diuels, and by the predictions and diuinations of Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and inuocators vpon euill ſpirits. For they who rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſuch inuentious of the diuell, then the true and ſacred word of God, deſerue to be holden in error, by the euents which they expect, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they truſt to the father of lying, to the end that they may afterward receiue their due and condemnation. So came it to <hi>Saul</hi> when he went to the witch,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.</note> to vnderſtand the iſſue and euent of the Philiſtims warre againſt him. For hee heard that which he deſired not to know; and that which was prophecied to him came to paſſe. Thus in three manners do we pereciue that Aſtrologers may oftentimes prognoſticate the truth. But becauſe ſome ſuppoſe to haue a very good foundation for iudiciall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, in ſo much as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith; ſpeaking of the creation of the ſunne and Moone and ſtarres,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1.</note> that God ſet them for ſignes; I would deſire them to conſider, that the Prophet expoundeth himſelfe in theſe words, [And God ſaid, Let there be lights in the firmament of heauen,<note place="margin">How the ſtars are giuen vs for ſignes.</note> to ſeparate the day from the night, and let them be for ſignes and for ſeaſons, and for daies and for yeeres: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heauen to giue light vpon the earth.] Heereby it is apparent to vs, that God created the planets to diſtribute the light, and to diſtinguiſh and ſignifie vnto vs by certaine ſignes the times, ſeaſons, yeeres, moneths, daies and nights, for all politicall, publike and priuate order. For it is moſt neceſſarie, that men ſhould direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues according to times and ſeaſons. But although the ſtarres were giuen vs for ſignes in this reſpect, and that after the deluge they were in that eſtate reordained by GOD: yet muſt wee abſtaine from ſuperſtition, &amp; too much curioſitie which abuſeth many in Aſtrologie (as is aboueſaid) and which often occaſioneth that they not being able to prognoſticate vpon euery cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently by the ſtarres, according to their deſire, do ſearch and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8737:77"/>
haue recourſe to other meanes, to wit, to Necromancy, and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie; by which they diuine what they liſt, leading men unto double error, and phophaning the contemplatiue doctrine of the heauen, which is otherwiſe of it ſelfe good and profitable.</p>
                  <p>But beſide all this I might likewiſe ſay, that if all things heere belowe were diſpoſed and directed by the gouernance of heauen, and the influence of the planets, as our naturaliſts (better Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers then Chriſtians) do maintaine: wee ſhould behold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaue what were good, as being gouerned by good cauſes. And in this caſe I demand what ſould become of thoſe euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the ſtarres, vpon which Aſtrologians do found their predictions?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1.</note> I will not heere alleage that which <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth vs, ſaying, that God ſaw that all things which he had made were good (for perhaps they would not beleeue it:) but let them giue eare to <hi>Mercury,</hi> whom the ancients called the thrice great and ſupreme in Philoſophie, Metaphyſicks, and Theologie. For he left written vpon pillars in Egypt (as <hi>Iamblicus</hi> in a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe declareth) how that all influences of the ſtarres are good:<note place="margin">Againſt ſuch as aſſigne euill to the influences of the ſtars.</note> and if there chance any euill, it muſt be imputed to the indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſubiect, and not to the planets: demonſtrating this by the brightnes of the ſunne, which of it ſelfe is good, and yet hurteth the bleare eie, becauſe of the badde ſtate thereof. <hi>Plato</hi> alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">Plato in Epime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide.</note> [God hath made the Moone encreaſing and decreaſing, and hath eſtabliſhed the moneths in the yeere, and hath taught by a kinde of happie fortune, to bring in count the number of them. Whereupon enſueth, that the earth being moſt fruitefull, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth and engendreth her fruite for the nouriture of man, at ſuch times as the windes gently blowe, and the raine proſperouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly droppeth into her lappe. But if any euill befall heerein, wee muſt not blame the diuine and celeſtiall nature but the humane, which leadeth an vniuſt life.] And the Stoicke <hi>Hieracles</hi> crieth out in the verſes of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in theſe termes.

And <hi>Plato</hi> in the ſixt booke of lawes, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks do teſtifie, that man hauing attained to the true doctrine becommeth a very diuine and perfect debonaire creature: but not hauing beene wel brought vp, he be commeth the moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8737:78"/>
of all creatures borne vpon the earth. What then remaineth for vs to attribute to the ſtarres? I demand of them alſo, who affirme ſome influences to be euill, from whence (will they ſaie) that this malice proceedeth? Whether from God which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth: or from the intelligence which mooueth the heauens: or from the heauen it ſelfe?<note place="margin">Reaſons to ſhew that the influences of the ſtarrs be not euill.</note> Surely it cannot come from God, who is the ſoueraigne good, &amp; the firſt cauſe ordaining all things. For that is euill or ſinne, which is done againſt the will of the creator, or which declineth from his iuſtnes: and in nature, euill cannot proceed from the ſpring of goodnes. Wherefore it ſhould be too fooliſh and abſurd a thing to thinke, that euill ſhould take original from God all-good: and that from the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne gouernour ſhoulde proceed the violation of the lawe, ſeeing that his will is his owne lawe it ſelfe. For the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or angel, which ſome ſaie continueth in the motion of the ſpheres, and to whom ſome aſſigne the cauſe of euill influences: I would faine aske them, whether this intelligence doth ſo worke by the commaundement of his Prince, which is the eternall and ſoueraigne gouernour of the world, or elſe againſt his will and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? If it accompliſh any thing according to his precept, certainely that cannot be bad: for nothing is bad but that which is done contrarie to the order eſtabliſhed by the prince of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But if it operate againſt his will, it might ſeeme to turne to the ſcandall of the Omnipotent creator, to ſuffer his ſeruants ſo arrogant in rebellion vnpuniſhed. For at the beginning he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not thoſe amongſt the angels, who exalted themſelues in pride: And for the reſt who perſiſted in obedience, hee in ſuch ſort confirmed them, that they cannot ſinne any more. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon alſo enſueth that the Intelligences, being loyall ſeruants of the Eternall, do not cauſe euill influences, neither yet do diſpoſe any thing to euill, ſince they alwaies accompliſh the ordinance of the Soueraigne-good.<note place="margin">Againſt ſuch as accuſe the heauens to be euill.</note> And for thoſe, who not being able to blame God, nor the moouing intelligence, doe accuſe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, as cauſe of euill influences: I deſire them to tell me; if the heauens be malitious, whence commeth their malice? Whether haue they beene created euill, or elſe beene depraued by euill manners? Or elſe, their nature failing them, did they become euill? Certainely they were not created euill by the moſt good woorker. Neither haue they beene depraued by manners or a failing nature, becauſe they haue no choiſe in their workes, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8737:78"/>
for that their motions and influences are naturall and inuariable, not of freewill, as all Philoſophers affirme. Againe I aske them, whether the heauens giue influence, as ſecond cauſes, or as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments? If as inſtruments, then ſith they neither mooue nor operate, but according to the will of the Prince, who created them; he ſhould remaine in fault: which is alreadie confuted. But if it be as ſecond cauſes, ſeeing the worke is performed by that which liueth, the error ſhould be referred to the intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who mooue them, and are ordayned for ſoules to the ſpheres: to which we haue alſo ſatisfied. I will farther adde this point, That the heauens do worke either by nature or by will. If by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſith the order thereof is eſtabliſhed by God, the ſentence of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is woorthie the remembrance, where ſaith, [What we poſſeſſe by nature, we are therein neither praiſed nor blamed: for the praiſe belongeth to the worker, and the blame cannot be aſſigned to the order of the ſoueraigne Good.] But if the heauens worke freely, being guided by an intelligence, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that being the cauſes of ſo many miſchiefes, which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly light on man, they are guided by a furious, or elſe by a couetous ſoule. If by a furious, ſeeing there is a certaine planet, which (as theſe Aſtronomers ſay) doth alwaies deſigne violent influences, wherefore is it not conſumed with ſuch a ſempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall furie? Moreouer why ſay men, that a planet is inflamed ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in one houſe, then in another? What meeteth it in his owne houſe or in another, that diſpoſeth it to ſignifie euill? Againe, how is that inflamed with furie, which they affirme to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable? But if the heauens be led by couetouſnes, what profit or gaine do they attract from things here below? For this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deſire remayneth onely in themſelues. And whoſoeuer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth euill, doth it (as the Philoſophers ſay) becauſe that he is as it were intoxicated and ouercome by inebriating matter. But ſith the matter of the heauens is far from all chaunge and error, it is neither inebriated nor ſubuerted. Wherewith then wil they blame the heauens? If any ſay that by nature they are euill,<note place="margin">Reaſon and originall of euill in nature.</note> how is it, that this euill ſhould come into their nature? For the Sages collect theſe reaſons and originall of euill in nature: either for that the efficient cauſe cannot gouerne the ſuperfluitie of the matter; or elſe cannot ſupply where it faileth; or elſe cannot du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſpoſe it; and ſuch other reaſons, as preſuppoſe a feeble po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the cauſe. But for as much as the ſmith and carpenter of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8737:79"/>
the heauens is of infinite power, how ſhould he faile in his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip? For there was no other cauſe which might encounter him, ſince that without any aide, he framed the heauens; neither could any thing reſiſt the infinite worker, who reduced all things into a due and proper eſtate, as we haue heretofore amply decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Yet notwithſtanding ſo many reaſons, how many are there which obſtinately leaning to the vaine and curious obſeruations of the ſtarres, as an infallible rule of the life and eſtate of man, do aboue all things feare, leaſt in the aſcendant of the natiuitie, any euill planet ſhould haue domination? And indeed do we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that Aſtrologers, and aboue all Magitians, are ſo much ſought after amongſt vs, that many do (as one may ſay) hold him to be miſerable, who knoweth not his Horoſcope?

                  <p>But let thoſe who ſo charge the ſtarres of crimes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turne ouer the bookes of Pagan Aſtrologers, and Atheiſts, rather then diuine writings, lend a while an care to ſome good witneſſes, whom they themſelues cannot reprooue, and who do euen praiſe the planet of Saturne, the malice of whom we haue heard to be ſo great. Behold then firſt of all, how the prince of the Aſtronomical doctrine depoſeth and teſtifieth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this planet in theſe termes:<note place="margin">Ptol. in 3. apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. How the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Saturne is good.</note> [If Saturne be only ſignifier in the eſtate of the minde, and Lord of the place of Mercurie, and of the moone, and blaſeth towards the corners of the world good aſpects and beames; the childe ſhall be a louer of good things, of great and firme counſell, and a ſearcher out of ſecret things and diuine.] Likewiſe <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> adorning this planet with many great praiſes, ſaith, that from his vertue proceedeth a quicke and ſubtile ſpirite in the deliberation of affaires, a certaine worde, a ſtable amitie, a long foreſight, and a roiall counſell. There be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many moderne Aſtronomers, who ſay of the ſame Saturne, That euen as the common and ciuill life is deſigned by Iupiter, ſo likewiſe the ſolitary and diuine life is appropriated to Saturne: Yea the ancient Philoſophers and Poets haue ſung that he is moſt good, and that the golden world did paſſe vnder him: fayning that Iupiter did afterward vſurpe the kingdome, hauing chaſed out Saturne, and that then began the ſiluer age.<note place="margin">Praiſe of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent poets.</note> And let vs note in regard of the moſt famous Poets amongſt the ancients, that they haue by their writings penetrated into the moſt profound cabinets of nature, and approched the ſecrets of the diuine thought. For they ſung not ieſtes (as ſome hold) which the old fathers would not mention to their little children: but they haue beene acknowledged of the Sages for great diuines, who hid the myſteries both of the one and other nature vnder the vaile of fables, and for this cauſe are they celebrated of ſuch as vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8737:80"/>
well their doctrine. That it is ſo, <hi>Ariſtole</hi> doth plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, in that the confirmeth great points of Philoſophie by the teſtimonie of <hi>Simonides,</hi> and of <hi>Homer.</hi> And <hi>Archeſilaus</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentor of the new Academie, aſcribed ſo much honour to <hi>Homer,</hi> that he neuer went to bedde, but he read ſome of his verſes firſt, and ſaide likewiſe in the day time (that he might haue more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to read) that he went to his beloued. <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> alſo, yea and our <hi>Baſil</hi> with laud admire the excellent vertue in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of this Greeke Poet. And how many be there likewiſe who eſteeme <hi>Virgil</hi> the imitator of <hi>Homer,</hi> for a doctor in all naturall and morall Philoſophie? For many referre all that, which he hath fained, to an allegoricall ſenſe. <hi>Lucretius</hi> alſo entreateth of all the precepts of Philoſophie in verſe. And <hi>Orpheus</hi> ſingeth more loftily then humane knowledge can extend to, the myſteries of Theologie and of the ſacred ceremonies, which he had learned out of holy letters, as himſelfe confeſſeth. <hi>Ouid</hi> likewiſe hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered many of the ſecrets of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> &amp; of the creation, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the vniuers, in his Metamorphoſis: but becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with too laſciuious a diſcourſe, he looſeth very much of their dignitie. Wherein he hath been imitated of many other Poets,<note place="margin">Againſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of this age.</note> as in this our age, wherein there are verie many, who doe the office rather of bauds, then of the true children of the chaſte Muſes, becauſe they delight to weaue poiſoning ſenſe in the web of their faire words. Such indeed <hi>Plato</hi> commaunded to be chaſed out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale. But to returne to our purpoſe; it is moſt euident that theſe ancient Poets, great Philoſophers &amp; Diuines, do teſtifie that Saturne is an happie and willing planet. And in ſo much as they accuſe him for deuouring all his children, except fowre, they themſelues interpret that of Time, by which indeed he conſumeth all things, except the fowre elements, which ſtill remaine, becauſe that out of them, and into them all nature is changed. And thereof it commeth, that they ſo call them, to wit, the fire Iupiter; the aire Iuno; the water Neptune, and the earth Pluto. Moreouer if wee will in excuſe of Saturne, conſider the cauſe of the malice, which commonly Aſtronomers attribute vnto him;<note place="margin">From whence the euils do proceed, which are attributed to Saturne.</note> it is certaine, that the euils wherewith they accuſe him proceed from his cold and drie nature, by which hee ſeemeth to fauour melancholie, whoſe propertie is to oppreſſe and ſtop the deſiring power and naturall loue, whoſe ſeate is hot and moiſt. And in that they ſeparate Saturne from humane ſocietie, we muſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8737:80"/>
vnderſtand, that this is not the planet which properly they meane, but rather the childe diſpoſed to ſuch complexion and diſpoſition, partly through the influence of the ſtarres, partlie through his birth and ſeed of the parents, or the place of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or of his foode, and partly alſo through the diſpoſition which he may get by nurture and manners: and eſpecially if the ſaide planet ruling in the natiuitie of the childe,<note place="margin">The meanes to correct all euill influences.</note> it bee inuaded with the drines of Mars, and coldnes of the Moone. But yet one may correct euery ſuch euill influence. For the childe increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in yeeres and iudgement may addict himſelfe to ſtudie and contemplation of high and diuine things, which are the delights of him, who leadeth a ſolitarie life: and doubtleſſe hee ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Saturne is not euill, but doth rather fauour him with a good influence. And if any finde himſelfe heauie by reaſon of his Saturnine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</note> let him meditate on that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, [Bleſſed are they which mourne:] if hee bee penſiue or ſilent, let him harken to that which is ſaid, [<hi>Marie</hi> hath choſen the good part:] if he haue deſire to ſtore vp riches, let him lay vp in heauen. For ſo may he eaſily correct euery euil inclination, which he ſhall naturally haue. And as much may we ſpeake of him who ſhal be ſtirred vp with the infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of Mars. For if the Martial choler maketh him haſtie, and ſubiect to anger, let him not vſe it againſt the poore and little ones, but to repreſſe vices. For as gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, [Where there is no wrath nor indignation, there ſcience profiteth nothing, the iudgements are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and crimes are not corrected.] Let then warres, murders, boldnes, magnanimitie, ſpoiles, captiuities, flights, violences, and ſuch like be exerciſed againſt the enemies of God, and for the publike peace: and then this <hi>Mars</hi> will not be euill,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nomb.</hi> 25.</note> but rather numbred amongſt the ſaints and ſeruants of God, with <hi>Phineas</hi> ſonne of <hi>Eleaſar,</hi> commended for his zeale, and with <hi>Dauid</hi> who fought the battels of the Almightie. But if among warriors there happen deceit, periurie frauds, temeritie, furie, man-ſlaughters, thefts, and ſuch miſchiefes; all this commeth to paſſe, bicauſe the rule of reaſon is broken. And then this gate being open, the winds of paſſions whiske out, and blow violently, like a great tempeſt. But ſo long as they remaine vnder the commandement of Eolus, to wit, ſo long as reaſon duly gouerneth; euery violent motion proceeding from Martiall choler, is eaſily moderated, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to profit. The like muſt be iudged of <hi>Venus,</hi> who is ſaide to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8737:81"/>
induce men to a luſtfull and laſciuious deſire. For if we gouerne well the concupiſcence or appetite heated by this planet, the ſunne and <hi>Mars</hi> thereto miniſtring feruor; thereupon woulde enſue a good loue inflamed towards God and our neighbor. So then we may conclude our ſpeech, that men do wrongfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of their nature, or the influence of the ſtarres, when they ſhould rather accuſe the peruerſnes of their il-inclined wil, which cauſeth their voluntarie ſinne, as in the ſecond part of our Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie we haue related. But this will be more cleere vnto vs, if we conſider how the ſtars worke in man, not in conſtraining, but diſpoſing: which (ARAM) ſhall be the ſubiect of your ſpeech.</p>

                  <p>MAny holding opinion, that we obtaine nothing by the influence of the ſtars, doe reiect the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Aſtrologians as abſurde, and altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther differing from philoſophie. And amongſt other reaſons, they alledge that there haue been many graue philoſophers, who haue applied their care and diligence, to ſearch out the cauſes of things, borrowing their knowledge from phiſicke, from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, and from many other arts and ſciences; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer looked after the cauſes in aſtrologie: namely <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Ariſtotle, Plotin, Auicen, Auerrois, Hippocrates,</hi> and others the moſt renowmed ancient authors. But one may anſwere them, that as it was forbidden by the Moſaicall lawe, that any ſhould reape his field all throughout,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.</note> but ſhould leaue ſome corner for the poore and needfull, whereof they might make bundles and fardles to ſuſtaine themſelues, and appeaſe their hunger: ſo it may be, that the former philoſophers haue left to their poſteritie, in the ſpatious field of the ſecrets of nature, ynough for others to gather and to ſearch out after them. And indeede if any one ſhould ſet himſelfe againſt vs, ſaying, [Saint <hi>Augustine, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Ierome, Origen, Damaſcene,</hi> and other doctors both Hebrues, Greekes and Latines, haue with moſt diligent labour ſounded the ſenſe of the ſcriptures, without touching that, which now you doe: wherefore that which you ſay, is not true.] What could this conclude againſt vs? For it is a common thing in ſchooles, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8737:81"/>
nothing is concluded of pure negatiues.<note place="margin">Nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by deny<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</note> And the Sages co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne not that, which any one hath found out for excellent by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie of his owne wit, though it neuer before had been touched by others. Wherefore no man is to be condemned, if he make a farther ſearch of cauſes, then many ancient philoſophers haue done, who would not paſſe the bounds of the elementarie nature, being contented to ſound the cauſes by the power and qualities of theſe inferior bodies, as many of our age doe, whoſe theoricke and practick doth too much faile. Let vs moreouer adde, that the moſt renowmed amongſt the ancients accord in this point.<note place="margin">Inferior things draw fauour from the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior.</note> [That the inferior things, and ſuch as are called naturall, doe drawe to them the fauor of the ſuperior and celeſtiall, rather by one aſpect then by another.] Which skil is holden excellent to be knowne. But for the Peripatetickes, who abaſed in their ſenſible obiects, content themſelues with the ſenſible qualities for the cauſe of all effects, ſaying, that if there be found any effect, ouer which ſuch a qualitie hath no power, that this proceedeth from a cauſe to vs vnknowne: we may euidently ſee,<note place="margin">Error of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle in the cauſe of the heat of the ſun.</note> that they haue erred in all their teachings. For when <hi>Aristotle</hi> intreateth in the Meteors of the heate of the ſunne, he ſaith, that it proceedeth from two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ioined togither: to wit, from his motion and place: not from his motion onely, as being quicker then <hi>Iupiter, Mars</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne:</hi> which foraſmuch as they are more remote, their inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in a very quicke motion, doth not attaine to vs. Neither alſo can the heate of the ſunne proceede from the moone, <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi> bicauſe that though they be neerer vnto vs, yet being more ſlow in motion, they are not ſo much inflamed. This reaſon he deliuereth, and this makes me to woonder, how a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo celebrated could imagine an inflammation in ſuch things, as receiue no ſtrange impreſſion. For he would attribute that to the diſtance and motion, which ſhould be referred to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertue. Might not ſome other then, better ſound the cauſe why the interiection of the ſunne beames doth bring heate, though <hi>Aristotle</hi> a moſt ſubtile ſearcher of naturall cauſes, could not attaine to it? Which perhaps he abſtained to doe, bicauſe he would not paſſe the limits by him appointed in his baſeſt philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, which he calleth naturall. Yet neuertheleſſe mounting ſomewhat higher, in that which he writeth to <hi>Alexander,</hi> he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that in taking of medicines the aſpect of the heauens muſt be diligently obſerued. But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> proceeding farther, doth

foretell the diſeaſes, recouerie and death, by the houſe of the Moone,<note place="margin">A phiſition muſt bee an Aſtronomer.</note> and the aſpects therof, with the other planets. And <hi>Haly</hi> in the beginning of the worke of this author, and according to his aduſe, ſaith, that the phiſition ignorant in aſtronomie, is like a blinde man that gropes for his way with his ſtaffe. Beſides, it would be too long to collect that which <hi>Plato</hi> in his obſcure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and diuers Academicks and vnknowne philoſophers, doe teach to be extracted from the heauens, both how, and when.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the power of the ſtarrs in men, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining but diſpoſing.</note>And what do the heauens by their continuall motion, but onely worke in vs? Some may ſay, they giue influence to the elements and to plants. But I demand; are not our bodies hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſunne; and altered, and (with cold) benummed by the Moone? The ſimple vulgar is not ignorant heereof. Why then do we not ſay, that the ſtarres communicate other influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces no leſſe knowne to the Sages, then theſe of the ſaid lights are to the vulgar? And yet not that their power performeth entire effects. For with them (as we haue heard) concur the diet, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, natiuitie, and place, but aboue all, the liberty of the minde is alwaies dominant, to moderate and gouerne all the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, which indeed proceedeth of the proper ſpirituall nature thereof, which mooueth the body; and not the bodie the minde: and with this conſenteth that which <hi>Ptolomie</hi> ſaith in the beginning of his Apoteleſmes, and in his booke of fruite, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus, [A good Aſtrologian may well preuent much euill, which otherwiſe might happen by the diſpoſition of the ſtarres, if he foreknow their nature, and forecaſt how to hinder that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not, and that the ill-diſpoſed ſubiect receiue no dommage by the place, by which it ſhould receiue profit. So then, wee ſhould not impoſe vpon Saturne; an harmefull ſadnes, or wicked ſeueritie: nor vpon Mars, a cruell raſhnes: nor on Mercurie, a cautelous malice: nor on Venus, laſciuious loues: nor an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant proceeding, on the Moone: no more then he that hath bleare-eies, ſhould impute his infirmitie to the light, nor the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of an houſe to the fire, nor the bruiſe to the ſtone; nor bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, priſons, and executions of malefactors to the ſeueritie of the iudge. For euery euill effect enſueth vpon the indiſpoſition of the ſubiect receiuing, and not vpon the influence of the ſuperior powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which (to the contrarie) we may maintaine (as already we haue done) to be of it ſelfe good ſtill, yea by the particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the ſtarres, according to the doctrine of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8737:82"/>
For thus many of them ſay [Saturne diſpoſeth the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual vertue, he prouoketh to wiſedome, and to contemplation of diuine and humane things, and pierceth to the brightnes of true Philoſophie. But if the Saturniſt applie his profound thoughts to euill, to accompliſh his diſordinate appetite, then he wholy intendeth to deceite, fraud and coggings, and yet the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt and diuineſt part thereof called Syntereſis, reſiſting it in him; then full of melancholie, he feeleth himſelfe ſo oppreſſed with anxietie and tediouſnes,<note place="margin">How the ſtairs become ill.</note> that he ſuppoſeth that moſt good and profitable, which is moſt noiſome and dommageable: and as he findeth himſelfe more oppreſſed with the often remembrance of his wicked life, many viſions do oftentimes preſent themſelues vnto him, like ſemblances of the dead, ſhadowes of the deceaſed, horrors of ſepulchers and tombes of ſuch as are departed. To the inner eie of his thought preſenteth it ſelfe the wrath of God, the aſſaults of the diuel, deſpaire &amp; hate of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as much may we ſpeake of the Martialiſt, who if he excite the violence and force of his courage, not to zeale of iuſtice as he ought to doe, but to accompliſh his deſires and carnall appetites: then commits he theeueries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rapes, and many other miſchiefes. So that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome will attribute euill to the planets, which are called wel-willing: For the ordinance of Iupiter, which by the hot and moiſt, or by a debonaire nature guideth to clemencie, might bee ſo much augmented, that the curbed and peruerted ſpirit might be forced to an entire diſſolution. So the noble and milde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Venus, which maketh man benigne, if it be not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, will make him be effeminate, and a ſlaue to all luſtfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. And the ſunne, father of life and giuer of light, directeth men to true wiſedome and roiall dignitie, and yet if the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the minde be abuſed, and that it be conuerted into pride, it mounteth into an ambitious preſumption, arrogancie, and ſcorne of others. Thus then may we ſay, that many euils may proceed from that which is good; as of the abundance of wine wherewith any man is glutted, doth ariſe the oppreſſion of the hart, abating of vertue, and many ſuch accidents: though being moderately taken, it reioiceth the hart, and comforteth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall powers. So the water likewiſe, which is a good element, and very profitable for all, drowneth and choaketh thoſe which take not heed thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ouerturneth thoſe buildings which are not very firme. Wherefore let vs conclude, that all influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

are good, ſo that the ſubiects be well diſpoſed, and can vſe them: and eſpecially, that the ſtarres and planets operate in man, not in conſtraining, but in diſpoſing his inclinations, the which by reaſon the minde may alwaies moderate and correct. And ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion vpon this matter, let vs come to the true Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and Aſtrologie of Chriſtians, which is to contemplate the glorie and greatnes of God by the worke of the heauens: as (ACHITOB) finiſhing this daies worke you may relate to vs.</p>

For it is by the courſe and meanes of the Sunne, that we haue ordinarily daies and nights, and that they be ſometimes longer, ſometimes ſhorter, and another time equall (as hath been already told vs) and alſo, that we haue the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8737:84"/>
diſtinction of yeeres, and of the diuers ſeaſons of them; as of the ſpring time, ſummer, autumne and winter, and of the time fit to ſowe, plant, till the earth, and to gather the fruites thereof, and generally to performe all other workes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for the life of man. And then may very well bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the courſe and compaſſe of this goodly light, which is from the one end of heauen to the other end, and how there is nothing that is hid from the heate thereof. Shall we let paſſe in ſilence the gallant courſe, which euery day it maketh, compaſſing the whole world in the ſpace of fower and twenty howers, without being any whit wearie? For from the hower, that God hath created it, it hath neuer deſiſted from worke day nor night, and hath neuer failed one iot, neither ſhal ceaſe, ſo long as the world ſhal endure. And therefore it is alſo ſaid in Eccleſiaſticus, [The ſunne alſo a maruellous inſtrument,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 43.</note> when it appeereth, declareth at his going out, the worke of the moſt high.] And preſently after, [Great is the Lord that made it, by whoſe commandement it doth runne haſtily.] Then ſpeaking in generall of all the planets and ſtarres, [It is a campe (ſaith he) pitched on high, ſhining in the firmament of heauen: the beautie of the heauens are the glorious ſtarres, and the ornament that ſhineth in the high places of the Lord. By the commandement of the holy one they continue in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and faile not in their watch.] And who is it, except the blinde, that beholdeth not this goodly ſunne, to paſſe out of his pauilion, like a magnificent king, that marcheth foorth of his palace? Who ſeeth not the faire countenance that he ſheweth to all, being as the eie, and mirrour of the whole world? Who vieweth not his trim locks, and the golden haires and yellow beard of his raies, by which he ſpreadeth his light, and heate vpon all creatures? In ſuch ſort that as none can auoide his heate, ſo none can flie from his light. For as it is written, [By the word of the Lord are his works:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 42. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 43.</note> The ſunne that ſhineth looketh vpon all things, and all the works thereof are full of the glorie of the Lorde.

The ſunne burneth the mountaines three times more then he, which keepeth a furnace with continuall heate: it caſteth out firie vapors, and with the ſhining beames blindeth the eies. Haſt thou commanded the morning ſince thy daies (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Iob</hi>) and haſt thou cauſed the morning to know his place?<note place="margin">

The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer riſeth early, and killeth the poore and needie, and in the night he is as a thiefe. The eie alſo of the adulterer waiteth for the twylight, and ſaith, None eie ſhall ſee me, and diſguiſeth his face. They dig through houſes in the darke, which they marked for themſelues in the day: they know not the light. But the morning is euen to them as the ſhadow of death; if one know them, they are in the terrors of the ſhadow of death.] By which teſtimonies aptly agreeing with that, which is written (euerie man that doth euill hateth the light) we may know,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> beſides the greatnes of the workes of God, which principally ſhineth in the creation of the Sunne, how euen they, who would not behold the light thereof but fly from it as much as they may, bicauſe they hate it and feare it as the death, cannot for all that auoide it. To the ende then that we may reape ſome profit by this diſcourſe, and ſo finiſh this daies talke, let vs thinke, that if the moſt ignorant and moſt dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, are inexcuſable for their ignorance and ingratitude towards God, for the ſermons of the heauens, which they continually make to all creatures: how much more are the learned, and chiefly Aſtronomers and Aſtrologians; if they know not verie well how to vſe their ſcience to the glorie of God.<note place="margin">Of the names of Aſtronomers and Aſtrologers, and of their true intent.</note> For they are called Aſtronomers, becauſe they haue the knowledge of the lawes and rules, which the ſoueraigne creator hath eſtabliſhed and ordayned among the ſtarres and their courſes and motions; according as their name deriued from the Greeke toong impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: as alſo the name of Aſtrologie will infer as much, ſeeing that thereby is ſignified, that they vnderſtand and can render a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the nature, and of the effects of the celeſtiall bodies. Wherefore then, ſith they haue greater knowledge, then the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and common people as well by the knowledge, as by the obſeruations and continuall experience of the effects of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, they ſhall be therfore found the more culpable before God, if they vnderſtand not the language of the heauens, thereby to learne how to glorifie him. And yet ſo far are the greater part of them from doing that which we ſay, that contrariwiſe we ſee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie many, which impute that to the ſpheres, that they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the ſpheres-creator, and ſo draw men from God their father, by the vanitie of their humaine dreames, vnder colour of

their Aſtronomie and Aſtrologie, cauſing them to ſtay in regard of the creatures with them, and ſo make them Atheiſts, as they are, when they acknowledge none other God, but an idoll of Nature. And therefore I deſire that we may to morrow againe proceed to behold the admirable effects of the Sun, being moſt apparant to all, and moſt eaſie for to know, by which the rudeſt and moſt ſimple may learne to come to God: as among other effects is that of the riſing and ſetting of this goodly light.

For in liew of committing themſelues to be guided by this booke, ſo to approch to God, as he pointeth out the path and way to thoſe, who haue eies to ſee and a ſpirit to vnderſtand; they rather take occaſion therein, by the vaine dreames of their own apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to wander from the truth. And for this cauſe <hi>Moſes, Dauid</hi> and the other Prophets and ſeruants of God, ſpeaking of the workes of the creation, and of the diuine prouidence in them, do propound vnto vs, but ſimply, thoſe which are the moſt apparant to al, &amp; the moſt eaſie to be vnderſtood, becauſe they wil not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach the moſt learned (who are they which willingly make leaſt profit in their writings) but will alſo inſtruct the ſimple and ignorant, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God doth oftentimes make capable of his ſecrets.

For it is verie neceſſarie that euerie one ſhould be inſtructed therein, according to his owne capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
                  <p>To purſue then our yeſterdaies ſpeech,<note place="margin">Vtility of the light and heat of the ſunne.</note> begun concerning the Sunne, which the holy Scripture ſetteth ſo often before our eies as an vniuerſal preacher of the ſoueraigne Maieſty, I pray you let vs firſt conſider, what ioy and what good it is, that men receiue by it, ſo long as it diſtributeth his light, as wee haue alreadie heard, being like the chariot of God to bring it to them. Likewiſe how much pleaſure and profit receiue they by his heat? Againe do we not ſee how he hath his determined time to make vs day? And how that after he hath lightned one part of the world, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch time as was aſſigned to him by God the creator, hee then tranſporteth his light to the other part? And when he hath performed his taske on one ſide of the world, he returneth to the other, without any ceaſing, reſt, or fainting. Wherein we muſt eſpecially acknowledge gods woonderfull prouidence, who hath created him neither greater nor leſſe then is neceſſary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the office, which hath beene committed to him. And for his greatnes we may truely iudge that it is immenſe and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe that in what place ſoeuer men may be, whether in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8737:86"/>
the eaſt, or in the weſt, or in the north, or in the ſouth parts, yet do they all behold it, of one ſelfe-ſame greatnes. And therefore doth the prophet ſay [They which dwell in the vttermoſt parts of the earth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.</note> are afraid of thy ſignes, and thou makeſt them ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with the going foorth of the euening, and the morning:] that is, with the riſing and ſetting of the ſunne, and other planets and ſtarres. Wherein we muſt note, that though we commonly ſay of the ſunne, that he riſeth and ſetteth, as if we ſpake of a man, that went to take his reſt in the night, after that he trauailed all day: yet in truth he neither riſeth nor ſetteth, for that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually buſie;<note place="margin">How the riſing and ſetting of the ſunne muſt be taken.</note> bringing day to ſome, when others haue night. But men ſay commonly ſo, becauſe that in regard of vs, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, when he retyreth, as if he went to reſt, at euen-tide: and that he riſeth in the morning, when he returneth vnto vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſay, that he is hidden and downe, when we ſee him not: and that he is riſen, when he appeereth at point of day. And ſo do the rude people and children, which dwel neere the mountaines, accuſtomablie ſay, that he is gone to hide himſelfe behind them. And they which are neere the ſea ſuppoſe, that he goeth to plunge &amp; waſh himſelfe therein: as the Poets alſo ſay, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating their ſtile to the vulgar. And yet al may behold that he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not on the ſame ſide where he ſetteth, but on the other quite oppoſite. Whereby is eaſie to be iudged, that he hath not repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the while that men ſlept, but hath paſſed much way. And that he ſtill carrieth his light with him, for it is a moſt certaine thing that he hath not deliuered night and darknes to thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nations, by which he paſſed; but light, and day. But if there be fewe amongſt the rude and ignorant, which meditate theſe things ſo farre; there be fewer, which conſider of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, that manifeſteth it ſelfe in this perpetuall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of day into night, and of night into day. For there is nothing more contrary then light and darknes, and conſequently then night and day? And yet hath God ſo well diſpoſed, compacted, and reconciled theſe contrarieties togither, that if things were otherwiſe ordained, there were neither man nor beaſt that could long liue vpon the face of the earth. And therefore <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 42.</note> [Oh how delectable are all his works, and to be conſidered euen to the very ſparks of fire: they liue all, and endure for euer; and whenſoeuer need is, they are all obedient.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8737:86"/>
any fault. The one commendeth the goodnes of the other, and who can be ſatisfied with beholding Gods glory?] And indeed if the day ſhould laſt perpetually, and equally alike in all parts of the world: the heat of the ſunne would ſo ſcorch euery thing that it would drie vp and conſume not onely men and beaſts, but euen all moiſture and humiditie which is in the earth.<note place="margin">Meruailes of the prouidence of God in the commodities of day and night.</note> Whereby all liuing creatures ſhould faile, for they could not liue for two cauſes. Firſt becauſe that life doth principally lie in heate and moiſture, and is conſerued by them, according to the order that God hath ſet in nature, to guard and maintaine it. Wherefore as men and beaſts looſe their life, if their naturall heat be altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extinguiſhed: ſo doth it likewiſe befall them, when their moiſture is entirely conſumed. For there muſt be a verie equall proportion in all thoſe qualities, which are in the bodies of liuing creatures, to wit, in heat and coldnes, in drines and moiſture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the fowre elements whereof they are compoſed; for the exceſſe of the one doth confound the other. For which cauſe God hath ſo diſpoſed the courſe of the Sunne, that hee diſtributeth his heate in ſo good and iuſt meaſure, that he hindreth the too much coldnes and moiſture, which might quench the naturall heate: and yet doth not ſo conſume them by the heat and drines which he cauſeth, but that there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies remaineth ſo much as is needful for the life of all creatures. And for the other reaſon that they would faile, it is, that neither man, nor any other animall can liue without nouriſhment, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire in them that, which the naturall heate, like a fire inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flaming, hath conſumed of radicall humor in their bodies: &amp; yet this heat muſt be likewiſe maintained that it be not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as wee haue amply diſcourſed concerning theſe things in the ſecond part of our Academie. For this cauſe then God hath ordained eating and drinking for the nouriture of all liuing creatures, and hath appointed to the earth as to the mother of al, the charge and office to produce fruits, and other nouriſhments needfull for them. Which ſhe cannot do being by nature cold and drie, if as ſhe is warmed by the heat of the ſunne, ſhe be not alſo moiſtned by the waters both of heauen &amp; earth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when that the ſunne hath heated and dried it vp all day long, the night (which is the ſhadow of the earth) doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enſue, and taking from vs the ſight of the ſunne and his light, doth by this meanes bring vnto vs darknes, which cauſeth
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8737:87"/>
night, wherein the Moone who is colde and moiſt, hath her rule; as the ſunne, who is hot and drie, hath his rule in the day time. And ſo we muſt conſider theſe two celeſtiall bodies very neerely, according to their proper effects, which we perceiue and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment heere on earth below,<note place="margin">

So then as the earth, and all that it beareth, togither with all animals or liuing creatures that it nouriſheth, are heated and dried vp in the day time by the ſunne: euen ſo are they moiſtned and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the night time by the withdrawing thereof, and by the humiditie and coldnes of the Moone. Wherein there eſpecially hapneth a mutuall accord betweene heauen and earth, vnder which we compriſe the aire, waters, and al creatures therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, with their natures and qualities. Moreouer in this maruel, we are to conſider, that as men and animals cannot ſuruiue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nouriſhment, which God hath prouided by the meanes aforeſaid: ſo likewiſe could they not liue without taking ſome reſt. For they are not of nature like the heauens, and planets which haue continuall motions, and yet weare not away. And therfore as God hath appointed the day for his creatures to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in, ſo hath he ordained the night for them to reſt in. And as waking is proper to trauell, ſo is ſleeping peculiar to reſt. In which, ſleepe being requiſite, and ſleepe requiring humiditie and freſhnes, the better to diſpoſe and induce liuing creatures to ſleepe, the night is much fitter therefore, and for reſt, bicauſe of the moiſt and colde nature thereof, then is the day, which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipateth moſt with heate and drines. And bicauſe all repoſe is in the night, it is alſo more quiet then the day: neither is there ſo much noiſe, which may hinder ſleepe and reſt. Wherein we haue yet another commoditie of the diſtinction and exchange of daies and nights, whereto we may likewiſe adde that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> declareth when he ſaith,<note place="margin">

When the ſunne riſeth, they retire and couch in their dens. Then goeth man forth to his worke, and to his labour vntill euening.] Behold heere goodly conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; how God hath prouided for the preſeruation of the life of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8737:87"/>
his creatures, by meanes of day and night. For becauſe that the wilde beaſts, which liue by praie are dangerous and cruell, he ſo guideth and gouerneth them by his prouidence, that he keepeth them quiet, and ſhut vp all day in their caues and dens, in ſuch ſort, that they ſeldome come foorth but in the night, to ſeeke their praie, euen then when men and domeſticall beaſts retire themſelues, and reſt out of their dangers.

Now euerie one ſeeth that the ſunne paſſeth and runneth through the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: &amp; it ſeemeth to many that the heauen ſtirreth not, though in truth it be otherwiſe. For it is the heauen which turneth, and taketh, and carieth away the ſunne with it, ſo cauſing him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his courſe.

For theſe cauſes then, there bee many, who cannot ſo-well acknowledge the excellencie, magnificence and diuine glorie,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8737:88"/>

For ſome are cold, others exceſſiue hot, ſome drie, and ſome wet, ſome tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and other ſome vntemperate. For according as the ſunne doth approch neere, or recule from vs, or as it is higher or lower, according as our ſight conſidereth it, and the ſituation of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and countries, which wee inhabite, doth preſent it vnto vs; and that his heate remaineth more or leſſe vpon the earth,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8737:89"/>
by meanes of his proper and particular courſe: ſo haue we the daies longer or ſhorter, and the nights likewiſe, and more or leſſe hot, cold, drie, and wet weather, and more temperatenes and vntemperatenes: So that it may ſeeme that the yeere is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by diuers ages, like to the life of man. And therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſay that the ſpring-time is as the infancie and childhood of the yeere: the ſommer like the youth and virilitie thereof: autumne like the ripe age inclining to oldnes: and winter like the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite and laſt age, wherein it ſeemeth that all is mortified, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead: then we behold the ſpring-time againe returne like a new creation and reparation of the world, and conſequently al the reſt of the ſeaſons, not failing of the time ordained to them. For as the ſunne neuer faileth to bring the day in due time: ſo likewiſe doth it not faile to diſtinguiſh alwaies vnto vs the diuers ſeaſons in euery yeere, in ſuch ſort as it hath done from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.<note place="margin">Power of the moone vpon all creatures.</note> The moone alſo hath her proper effects in all theſe things, and is very powerfull as well among liuing creatures, as among the fruits of the earth; through the changes, which are in her. For it is ſeene by experience, that according as ſhe encreaſeth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, ſo doe the humours in all creatures augment and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and are tender or firme, and change diuerſly. Moreouer, as this planet altereth hir courſe, ſo doth the weather change in diſpoſition, turning ſometimes into raine, ſometimes being faire, and ſometimes tempeſtuous. But aboue all, the power which God hath placed in hir, manifeſteth it ſelfe moſt euidently in the waters of the ſea, eſpecially in the flowings and ebbings thereof. And although that amongſt ſo many effects produced by theſe two goodly lights,<note place="margin">Teſtimonie of the prouidence of God in the harmonie of the ſeaſons of the yeere.</note> there are great contrarieties and maruellous differences: yet God by his prouidence can reduce them to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular agreement, and make them all returne to one bound and point. For the exceſſe of the one is the temperature of the other. For as one ſeaſon is apt to ſowe and plant in, ſo is another fit to make the fruits grow, and ripen in: and another is proper to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in, and prepare them to ſerue our vſes. And as the cold and drought doe much hinder corruptions and infections, which might ariſe through exceſſiue heate and wetnes: ſo doth heate and moiſture temperate the great cold and drineſſe, and conſerue and repaire that which they would deſtroy: ſo that by the one of theſe qualities the defect of the other is ſupplied, and the exceſſe of the one is the temperature of the other: as we haue heard that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8737:89"/>
there commeth to paſſe, by the ſucceſſion of day and night, which cauſeth that many commodities do flow to men and animals. By how much the more we conſider of theſe things, by ſo much the more ſhall we finde occaſion to woonder at the works and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. For whereas the propertie of one contrarie is to deſtroy another: he hath ſo well tempered and reconciled them, that he cauſeth the one to be preſerued by the other: yea that the one cannot ſubſiſt without the aide of his companion. Which taketh place not onely in theſe things, which we haue here alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die mentioned, but likewiſe in all creatures, which are in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall world. For it is all compoſed of contrarie natures. And yet God their father maketh them to fit ſo well togither, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth all diſcord into concord, and all enimitie into amitie: as the example is notable in mans bodie being compounded of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and qualities cleane contrarie one to another; and yet conioined by ſuch a vnitie, that the compoſition and preſeruation is moſt firme and aſſured, ſo long time as it pleaſeth God to maintaine his worke. But this matter will be more cleerely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, when we ſhall diſcourſe of the elementarie world. Yet before we leaue the woorthie ſubiect, which hath been giuen vs to diſcourſe vpon the celeſtiall fires, it will not be a little fruitfull, if we conſider of the image of God, and of his eternall light, which is propoſed to vs in the ſunne: and how the felicitie of mans life is repreſented by changing of the light into darknes.

                  <p>Purſuing then this doctrine of the holy ſcriptures, wee muſt learne by that which hath been propounded vnto vs, concerning the image of God in the ſunne, and by the diſcourſe of his light, and of the darknes contrarie thereto,<note place="margin">Woorthie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the effects of the ſunne.</note> how the ſoueraigne and great eternall Sunne hideth his face from vs, and how he ſheweth it vnto vs, and what good, and what euill doth thereby redound vnto vs, according as his word teacheth vs in the fore-alledged teſtimonies. For as we haue in the courſe of nature, one while day, and another while night; and thoſe ſometimes long, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhort; and as many of one as of another; in one ſeaſon ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in another winter; now hot, anon cold; then drie, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wet; ſo at this time tempeſt, preſently calme weather: euen ſo runnes all the courſe of mans life. For we haue therein the time
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8737:91"/>
of ignorance and aduerſitie, of chaſtiſements, puniſhments, and vengeance of God, which are the night and time of darknes to men, and their winter and tempeſtuous ſeaſons. And ſo haue we the time of knowledge and vnderſtanding of God, and of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, of grace, of ioie, of felicitie, and of conſolation, which are to men like the day and the light, and as the ſpring-time &amp; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And as the daies and nights are ſome longer, and ſome ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo the Lord prolongeth or abridgeth the times of grace and of rigor; of his fauor and of his wrath, as he pleaſeth, and in ſuch meaſure as he knoweth to be expedient, as well for his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as for the good of his elect. Wherefore as we expect day after the night; the ſpring-time and ſommer after autumne and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo in the time of aduerſitie we muſt attend in good confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the time of proſperitie, as we are aſſured to haue light after darknes. Likewiſe as in the day time we looke for the night; and for autumne and winter after the ſpring-time and ſommer: ſo in time of proſperitie we muſt prepare for aduerſitie. For as it is written, [To all things there is an appointed time,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.</note>] and therefore there is a time of ioy, and a time of ſorrow, a time to laugh, and a time to weepe. Now if we could conſider theſe things by the courſe of the ſunne, and by the change and ſucceſſion of the daies and nights, of the light and of darknes, and of the diuers ſeaſons, which ſucceed in each yeere: we ſhould learne in this ſchoole a moſt profitable and laudable Aſtronomie, which is not found in the bookes of <hi>Ptolemie,</hi> nor of all the other Aſtrologers, how skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoeuer they were, which haue written concerning the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſtars. For when we ſhould be in proſperitie, we would take heede not to abuſe our ſelues, to miſgouerne our ſelues, and become too inſolent, as it ordinarily commeth to paſſe, when we are too much at our eaſe, and thinke it will be alwaies ſo with vs. And thereupon enſueth, that ſo ſoone as we are deceiued of our perſwaſion, we become deſperate, bicauſe that we find our ſelues in the danger and ſnares of miſchance before we thinke of it. But when we ſhall conſider the reuolutions and changes which haue been accuſtomed to come to the world: we ſhall foreſee like good Aſtrologers and prognoſticators, the tempeſt comming a far off, and the eclipſes of the ſunne and of the moone; and while it is day, we ſhall prepare for the night: and in ſommer time for the winter, like good houſe-keepers. So likewiſe being in aduerſitie, we ſhall not looſe courage nor deſpaire: but we ſhall comfort
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8737:92"/>
our ſelues in the hope of Gods helpe, and will patiently endure the bad ſeaſon, vntill ſuch time as he hath by the light of his fauor and grace chaſed away the darknes of the ſcourges of his wrath and vengeance. Thus concluding the ſubiect of our ſpeech, let vs intreate eſpecially of the eclipſes of the ſunne and moone, and of their nature and effects.

                  <p>THe conſideration of the eclipſes of the ſunne and moone hath opened to men the knowledge of many excellent ſecrets in nature, as the writings of the learned make mention.<note place="margin">Cauſe of eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> Now they concur all in this point, that the eclipſe of the ſun happeneth through the diametrall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the moone betweene it and the earth: and that the ſhadow of the earth reaching out betwixt the ſunne and moone, cauſeth hir alſo to be darkened &amp; eclipſed: So that as the moone depriueth the earth of the brightnes of the ſunne-beames; ſo likewiſe doth the ſhadow of the earth hinder the moone of the ſolarie illumination. But the eclipſes of theſe two planets doe differ greatly:<note place="margin">Difference of eclipſes.</note> for that of the ſunne happeneth not through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of light in the bodie thereof, as it doth in the eclipſe of the moone. For the ſunne is neuer without light, inaſmuch as it is the proper ſubſtance thereof. But when the earth is directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two planets, then doth the moone become thorough darke, bicauſe ſhe retaineth no light, at leaſt that may appeere to vs, but onely ſo much as ſhe receiueth from the ſunne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then according as her courſe is direct, or oppoſite in reſpect of that of the ſunne, ſhe doth augment or decreaſe in light, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually changing hir eſtate in apparance, and according as wee behold hir, though that in effect, and according to the veritie of hir eſſence, ſhe hath alwaies one halfe lightened by the ſunne. For we muſt vnderſtand, that the moone is round like a bowle,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8737:92"/>
and that alwaies, except when ſhe is eclipſed,<note place="margin">How one moity of the moone is euer light.</note> ſhe receiueth light from the ſunne into one halfe of her globe, the other halfe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without brightnes. But inſomuch as ſhe mooueth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, therefore according as ſhe retireth from, or approcheth to the ſunne; ſo doth ſhe appeere diuers in her light: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding doth illuminate at all times one moitie of hir cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, from one part to another, that is, from hir ſuperior part to hir inferior part, or from hir inferior to hir ſuperior part. Now hir inferior or lower part is that which looketh towards the earth, all of which, or any part thereof we behold when it is lightened: and hir ſuperior or vpper part is that which is towards the ſphere of the ſunne, which we cannot behold although it be illuminated by him. Now once a moneth all hir inferior moitie receiueth the brightnes of the ſunne, and then doth ſhe appeere vnto vs full of light: which commeth to paſſe on the fifteenth day of the moones age, bicauſe that then ſhe doth oppoſitely confront the ſunne. Another time the ſuperior moitie is fully illuminated, to wit, when ſhe is conioined with the ſunne, which is ouer hir; and then is hir lower part darkened, not appeering to vs for two daies: which commeth to paſſe at the ende of the moone: and all the reſt of the moneth ſhe hath diuers illuminations. For from hir coniunction with the ſunne, the light in the vpper part begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to faile, and by little and little to come to the lower part towardes vs, according as ſhee mooueth, reculing from the ſunne: and ſo doth till the fifteenth day, wherein all the inferior part towardes the earth is ſhining, and the ſuperiour part is cleane without light. After which time the light beginneth to conuey it ſelfe to the vpper moitie, decreaſing by little and little towards vs in the lower moitie, which at laſt is left cleane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out brightnes, and the other which wee ſee not becommeth all ſhining. And it is to be noted, that the hornes of the Moone which hir diuers aſpect ſheweth vs, turne their back-parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſunne: and if ſhee encreaſeth, they are turned towards the ſunne riſing; if ſhe be in the waine, they turne to the ſun ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. She ſhineth moreouer, adding to each day three quarters and the fower and twentith part of an hower, beginning from the ſecond day, till the time ſhe make full moone; and from that time forwards vſing the like ſubſtraction euery day, till the time that ſhe appeereth no more at all. And when ſhe is within fower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene degrees of the ſunne, ſhe is ſeene no more. Whereby it

appeereth,<note place="margin">The moone ſmaller then the other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</note> that all the reſt of the planets are greater then the moone: for none of them is hidde or obſcured by the beames of the ſunne, except it be within ſeuen degrees thereof. But in that they are all of them higher then the moone is, they ſeeme to be leſſer: ſo in the ſame conſideration it commeth to paſſe, that the brightnes of the ſunne hindreth vs of the ſight of the fixed ſtars in the day time, which neuertheleſſe ſhine as well in the day as in the night time; as may be perceiued at the eclipſes of the ſunne, as likewiſe in a very deepe pit, if one ſhould deſcend thereunto in the day time.<note place="margin">Things to be conſidered in the ſhadow of the earth.</note> Moreouer all theſe ſtars are neuer eclipſed: For the ſhadow of the earth, which cauſeth the moone to looſe hir light, reacheth not beyond her heauen. And the night alſo, is no other thing but the ſhadow of the earth, which ſhadow is in forme like a pyramis; growing ſtill leſſe and leſſe taperwiſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a point, till at laſt it fadeth: For all ſhadowes waxe leſſe and leſſe till they be cleane diminiſhed by diſtance, as may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently bee ſeene by ſhadowes of birdes, which flie in the aire. Now the ſhadow of the earth finiſheth in the aire at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the region of fire: &amp; aboue the moone al things are pure: wherfore it is not poſſible that the terreſtriall ſhadow can hinder the brightnes of the ſtars, which are aboue the moone. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore likewiſe we behold them in the night time like a candle in a darke place. But the ſhadow of the earth is the very cauſe that the moone is eclipſed alwaies by night.<note place="margin">Why the eclipſes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not euery month.</note> And it is to be noted, in that, that the eclipſes both of the ſunne and moone happen not euery moneth, that it is by reaſon of the obliquenes of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke, and of the variable motions of the moone, which being ſometimes north and ſometimes ſouth (as wee haue heeretofore declared) meeteth not alwaies in coniunction, or in oppoſition in the knots of the ecliptick circle, which are in the head, or in the taile of the dragon. We may note alſo, that the conſideration of the ſhadowes and eclipſes aforeſaid, hath taught men to iudge of the greatnes of the ſunne, of the moone, and of the earth.<note place="margin">How one may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the ſunne by the eie, or by coniectures, ſith that the trees plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the way ſide haue all of them their ſhadowes proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably equall, though there be much diſtance of ground betwixt them: as if the ſunne were in the midſt of them, and did giue light to all alike. And during the time that the ſunne is in the Equinoctiall-point, ouer the ſoutherne climates and regions, he caſteth his light downe right, without making any ſhadow: and yet in the north regions on this ſide the ſolſtice-circle, the ſhadowes fall on the north ſide at noone, and toward the weſt at ſunne riſing, which could not happen if the ſunne were not very much greater then the earth. But leauing this diſcourſe, we muſt out of our ſpeech learne ſome point of Chriſtian Aſtrologie. Now we haue heard, that the moone hath no light of her ſelfe (at leaſt that can appeere vnto vs) but ſo much as ſhe receiueth from the ſunne, according to the diſpoſition or oppoſition of their diuers courſes: in ſuch ſort, that the moon neuer perſiſteth in one eſtate, but changeth inceſſantly. But it is not ſo with the ſunne, for he hath alwaies as much light, at one time as at another, and is not ſubiect to any change. I ſay then that in him we haue a goodly image of the conſtant and immutable God, who is alwaies one,<note place="margin">The image of God in the ſunne.</note> and euer without any variation, and who, firme in his counſell, hath ordained concerning all things for euer, according to his endleſſe, right, and iuſt will.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. In the moone is an image of the creatures.</note> So contrariwiſe we haue repreſented to vs in the moone a perfect figure of the creatures, by which is demonſtrated vnto vs, that all things vnder heauen are mutable and ſubiect to continuall change: and alſo that according as we receiue our ſaluation in Chriſt through faith, and as we increaſe therein; in ſuch degree are wee made partakers of his diuine light and of all his graces and bleſſings, euen as the moone parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipateth of the brightnes of the ſunne.<note place="margin">Many woorthy points to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſtrology.</note> Moreouer we ſhall haue learned a woorthie point of Chriſtian Aſtrologie, when we ſhall conſider, that as theſe two celeſtiall planets haue perpetuall alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and communication togither: euen ſo the coniunction which is betwixt Ieſus Chriſt and his church is eternall. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according as it is ſaid in the common prouerbe, (God kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the moone from wolues) the faithfull may very aptly ſpeake this of themſelues concerning their enemies, bicauſe they are much ſurer in the alliance of the Almightie, and vnder his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. For as the ſunne ſhall neuer be without the moone, nor the moone without the ſunne: ſo the eternall ſonne of God ſhall
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8737:94"/>
neuer be without his church, nor his church without him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſee it ſometimes increaſe, and ſometimes decreaſe, and ſometimes as if it cleane failed, and were vaniſhed, like the eclipſed moone. But as the moone doth not ſo faile by any eclipſe that can happen, but that it perſiſteth to remaine a moone ſtill, though ſhe be not ſeene of men: ſo the church can neuer cleane faile, nor bee ſo conſumed, but that it ſhall euer bee a church, notwithſtanding that it may ſeeme to humane ſight and exterior appeerance to be nothing at all, and without any vigor. For it is founded vpon the firme rocke which is Ieſus Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the power of hell cannot preuaile againſt it nor waſte it. And the Lord can alwaies tell who be his, though men knowe it not. Next we muſt learne, that as the moone is eclipſed, when ſhe is ſo oppoſed to the ſunne, that the ſhadowe of the earth, ſpread out betweene them both, hindreth her to receiue that light from him, which ſhe is accuſtomed to attract: ſo commeth it to men in the church when their ſinnes are like an obſcure cloud, and an obſtacle, which hindreth the fauor and grace of God, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine to them; and when there be miſts and darkneſſes of ignorance, which doe detaine them from beholding of Ieſus Chriſt the true ſunne of their ſoules, and to commit themſelues to be guided by the light of his worde. But as the ſunne faileth not though hee be eclipſed in regarde of vs; ſo the ſoueraigne head of the elect doth neuer faile to his church; though hee may ſeeme ſometimes to bee abſent, and quite withdrawen: for hee alwaies ſupporteth it by his power. And therefore alſo it is written that the woman (by whome the church is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified) hath the moone vnder hir feete:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apocal.</hi> 12.</note> which is as much to ſay, as that the conuerſation of the children of God, which are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church, is not in earth, but in heauen (as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> teſtifieth) and that they haue already put vnder their feete all worldly things,<note place="margin">

It is moſt certaine, that the number of theſe is verie ſmall in reſpect of thoſe worldly men,<note place="margin">Man ſubiect to greater changes then the moone.</note> who following the nature of elementarie and corporall things, are ſubiect to greater changes then the moone hirſelfe: which being lower then all the other ſtars &amp; planets, &amp; by ſo much neerer to the earth, receiueth likewiſe ſome mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

greater then the reſt of the ſtarres: as if God would repreſent vnto vs in her, the changings, whereto the elements and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures compoſed of them, which are vnder the celeſtiall ſpheres, are ordinarily ſubiect. And yet doth not the moone change from her proper nature, which was ordained by the creator from the beginning, as we haue already declared: yea though that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of vs, and of our ſight, ſhe haue the foreſaid mutations; yet doth ſhe neuer faile, but doth euermore repaire himſelfe, and preſentlie renue: ſo that we ſee her not weare away in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that ſhe perſiſteth without ceaſing in her proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall courſe. But it is not ſo with men, who change not onelie from day to day, but alſo from hower to hower, from inſtant to inſtant, from age to age. For as they daily proceed in growth of body and of ſtrength, from the hower of their conception and birth from time to time, vntill they be arriued to their full vigor like the full moone: ſo after they are aſcended to this degree, they alwaies abate and decline, till their extreameſt age, and to death, wherein they vtterly faile in reſpect of this life, as if they had neuer beene. For they cannot do like the moone, who after her defect doth continually repaire and reſtore herſelfe, till ſuch time as ſhe ſhew herſelfe full and entier: But they are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to attend for that laſt day,<note place="margin">

So then in that day ſhall we be renued in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent eſtate for euer. Behold then what (me ſeemeth) we muſt conſider like chriſtians vpon our diſcourſes of the ſunne and of the moone. And hauing hitherto entreated of the heauenlie world, and of the ſpheres ſufficiently to content a Chriſtian aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer: we will now proceed to deſcribe the elementary world: whereof (ASER) you ſhall begin to ſpeake; inſtructing vs in the principles of naturall and corruptible things.</p>

ſay, the ſubſtance or ſtuffe, which ſome alſo haue named (Chaos) and which is properly deſcribed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in theſe Hebrew wordes (Tohu &amp; Bohu) which is as much to ſay, as I wot not what thing without forme, containing by poſſibilitie all that which could be formed. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Timaeo calleth it a Boſome without forme, a power which is mother of the world, a nurſe, a ſubiect, and a receptacle of formes; and ſaith that it was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by any quantity, nor by any degree. And bicauſe that out of this firſt ſubiect innumerable things were to be produced, <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> diſputeth how that in the ſame were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained infinit formes and numbers not limited, which the onely vnderſtanding and thought creator of all things had drawne out in effect. And this <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attributeth to nature, though ſometimes he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to diſtinguiſh this nature from God, and make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, oftentimes repeating theſe words [God, and Nature made] or [made nothing without cauſe.] Now for vs wee know, that that nature which the philoſophers called diſpoſing &amp; diſtin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guiſhing, can be nothing elſe but God only, as appeereth by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaſons which we haue heretofore deduced. Wherefore hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this to be confeſſed, we muſt be ſure, that the perpetuall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of things, declareth that it is a matter which hath at firſt beene made by ſome other meanes. For corne commeth of the earth, and of humor: animals of ſeede, and of bloud or egges: aſhes are made by wood, and there is nothing ſo little but it is made of ſome ſubiect. But in all theſe generations, it is neceſſarie that ſomething remaine, from which they are drawne in their firſt originall. When then any creature is engendred by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the forme periſh, and any thing do remaine, it muſt (of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie) be the matter:<note place="margin">Nothing can cleane periſh.</note> which the corruption it ſelfe doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, becauſe that nothing can wholy periſh ſo long as it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. For the apple periſheth, and is conuerted into wormes, ſo is the wood into cinders when it is burned: ſo water chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it ſelfe into vapors and ſmoke by the heate of the fire, or of the ſunne. Now all vapor and ſmoke is ſomething, for it can ſtifle a man, and if it be receiued and gathered into a veſſell, it turneth to drops of water. Behold then how manifeſt it is, that in all this vniuers there is a certaine thing hidden vnder euerie forme, which is not made by common generation, nor yet doth periſh by corruption: and which like ſome prime ſubiect, being diuided vnder many and ſundry formes, wee call, as we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8737:95"/>
ſaid, the firſt matter not engendred, permanent, becauſe it periſheth not, but remaineth and conſiſteth according to the effect thereof. And when we compare it to the formes, we ſaie that it is by power the ſame which they are, becauſe that it can receiue all formes: ſo that the matter of a childe being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is ſaid to be a childe by power; and by effect it is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, whereof the childe may conſiſt: for it is a mixture ſo faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſuch as one may ſee it. But when it is compared to the forme of the childe, it is ſimplie called a matter by power: for if it were ſuch by effect, then were it a childe of it ſelfe, &amp; not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of him. So then by the conſent of all Philoſophers, there is a certaine groſſe matter disfurniſhed of formes, but capable of all, though by nature it be depriued of all. For which cauſe alſo they eſtabliſh with this matter, priuation,<note place="margin">Of priuation of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging cauſe.</note> for a beginning of naturall things. And mounting higher, they conſider of a changing or working cauſe, by force whereof, the matter being wrought and mollified, which is onely in power, is at length actually perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: euen as waxe being plied and ſoftned by handling and working in the hand is faſhioned into diuers formes, according to the will of him that doth it.<note place="margin">Of the finall cauſe.</note> And becauſe that nature doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at aduenture, but al for ſome good purpoſe: thence it is that the finall cauſe is by ſome conſidered as a principle.<note place="margin">Of the forme.</note> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe that the neereſt end of the working cauſe is the forme, which it taketh out of the boſome of the matter, and that for this intent it worketh and mouldeth it, to the end to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to a perfect eſtate to receiue a forme: for theſe cauſes <hi>Aristotle</hi> conſtituteth the forme for the third principle. The which cannot be drawne out of the wombe of the matter, except it be firſt diſpoſed, and prepared by conuenient qualities: and therefore the Philoſophers ſay, that about them the maker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth and emploieth all his labour, and all the time of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the end that the ſpecies may preſently appeere in a point &amp; moment vnſeparable, as it were for the wages of his paines. But the Peripateticks call the worker the cauſe, rather then a principle.

of a cunning workeman though they compoſe, place and change the whole matter of an houſe, as wood, ſtone, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that nothing beſides them may bee ſeene, whereto the faſhion of the edifice might bee attributed: yet are they knowne of vs to be an inſtrument obeying and ſeruiceable to the Idea, which being ſeated in the minde of the Architect, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth and acteth with his hands in ſenſible matter, the worke which he hath conceiued. And for this occaſion the Academicks ſpeake of theſe two cauſes (the inſtrumental and the exemplarie cauſe) when they intreat of the framing of all things. Which me thinketh is often confirmed by the Peripatetickes, when this axiom is read in their writings, [Euerie worke of nature is the worke of Intelligence.] And both the one and the other do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that God hath drawne all things out of the matter. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that for to drawe them out, the matter muſt neceſſarily be preſuppoſed, and the forme which thereof is faſhioned muſt be conceiued, as alſo the power or application and diſpoſition of the ſaid matter:<note place="margin">Three principles according to Ariſtotle.</note> Thereupon are ſprung the three principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ordayneth; to wit, matter, forme, and priuation. Which opinion <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſeemed to leane vnto; teaching that in the firſt production of things, there were preſent the Euen and the Odde: for the Euen (according to the doctrine of thoſe which doe philoſophically diſcourſe by numbers) and principally the binarie (or number of two) ſignifieth the matter, and the vneuen or odde betokeneth the forme. Moreouer, the degrees of formes and things compoſed, are excellently and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly diſtributed by the Euen and Odde numbers, as by their writings we may eaſily learne. But let vs note, that that which the Pythagorians ſignifie by numbers, <hi>Plato</hi> doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly deſcribe by greatnes and ſmalnes: becauſe all that which is, doth retaine a greater or leſſe degree of eſſence and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which neuertheleſſe is diſtinguiſhed by euen and odde num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And if one ſpeake of bodies, euery one of them hath a great, little, or meane quantitie: which likewiſe is by the ſame numbers limited and diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>But to leaue the curious diſputation concerning theſe things to the Philoſophers, and ſo to grow to the concluſion of our ſpeech concerning the principles of naturall and corruptible things; we muſt call that into our memorie, which we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie declared: how that the matter ſtood in need of a worker
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8737:96"/>
and ordayner. Now this ſame is none other,<note place="margin">Of one alone, and onely prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</note> but the alone and onely principle of principles, and the cauſe of cauſes, God omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, author of the Vniuers: who being a ſoueraigne worker, hath produced out of the ſubiect by him created all compound bodies. From whom likewiſe it is neceſſarie, that all formes doe flow, whether they be drawne out of the boſome of the matter (as ſome Philoſophers affirme) or proceed without any meanes of the forme-giuer, as many learned diſpute; for he muſt alwaies be ſaid to be engendring and producing, which draweth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into an effect by any manner whatſoeuer. Moreouer,<note place="margin">Motion, and place ſet by ſome for principles.</note> ſome ſubtile ſpirits do account among the principles of naturall things Motion and Place. For they ſay that the principle Motion ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be naturally in all bodies; of which ſome, as light, are carried aloft; others, as heauie, deſcend downe: and yet are they not forcibly driuen; for then violently they would returne to their proper place. Neither are they drawen: for the place is an accident and draweth no element at all. Then forſomuch as all motion is made in place, it ſeemeth verie well that it muſt be ſet for one of the principles of all things. Now place is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ſuperficies of euerie bodie, enuironing the ſame round about: which ſuperficies remayneth, the bodie being ſeparated. And euerie place is equall to the bodie therein contayned. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bodie likewiſe is in a place, and in euerie place is a bodie. For euerie bodie hath his extreme ſuperficies, and the place cannot be without a bodie, conſidering that euerie place is the higheſt ſuperficies contayning a bodie. And when the place is taken in regard of the roundnes of the heauens, it is immutable, inſomuch as it contayneth the entire bodie of the Vniuers. But being conſidered as the ſuperficies of any particular bodie, it is changed by the diuers diſpoſition and alteration of the creatures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth not alwaies the ſame. Behold then that which I haue thought worthie to be ſummarily noted in regard of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereof the Philoſophers diſpute, and of which, and by which, namely of the forme and firſt matter, the ſenſible elements of all corruptible things doe conſiſt and are compoſed.

And yet in the diuiſion of the world there are commonly mentioned but two principall parts: that is, the celeſtiall and the elementary part, as we haue heretofore related. Now vnder this laſt part, whereof our enſuing diſcourſe muſt entreat, we muſt vnderſtand all that, which is comprehended within the concauitie or hollow vault of heauen, vnder the Moone, euen to the center of the earth:<note place="margin">Of the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary region.</note> that is, the fower ſimple elements, which are Fire, Aire, Water and Earth, inceſſantly employed in the generation and corruption of all creatures, vnder the which part we compriſe all the diuers and innumerable ſpecies of all bodies, both perfect and imperfect,<note place="margin">The number and qualities of the elements.</note> materially engendred by the naturall commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and power of the ſaid elements. Which cannot be in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aboue fower; that is iuſt ſo many, and neither more nor leſſe then there are firſt qualities predomina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in them, which are heat, moiſture, colde and drienes; which neuertheleſſe alone and by themſelues do not conſtitute an element: for they cannot haue the power both to doe and to ſuffer; as it is needfull that there ſhould be in the generation and corruption of all things: neither can the foreſaid qualities conſiſt aboue two together, for feare leaſt contrarie things ſhould be found in one ſelfe ſame ſubiect; but being ioyned two and two, they are correſpondent the one to the other, as the qualities of heat and drines, which are in the fire: the heat &amp; moiſture, which are in the aire: cold &amp; moiſture, which are in the water: and cold &amp; drines, which are in the earth. But heat &amp; cold which are actiue qualities, and moiſture &amp; drines
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8737:97"/>
which are paſſiue qualities, are altogether contrarie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can they not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt both together in one ſelfe ſame element:<note place="margin">Scituation of the elements.</note> wherupon it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that the fire &amp; the water, the aire &amp; the earth are cleane contrarie one to another, which cauſeth alſo that the fire, as the moſt ſubtile &amp; lighteſt element tending natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vpwards, is placed aboue the other three elements, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironeth the aire round about, which agreeth in heate with it: which aire encompaſſeth the water, agreeing therewith in moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: and the water is diſperſed about the earth, and agreeth therewith in coldnes; and the ſame earth, as the moſt heauie and hardeſt element, is heaped and compacted togither in the midſt of the whole world, containing the center thereof. It is certaine, that the water enuironeth not the earth cleane round about, but is ſpread abroad by diuers armes, branches, and lakes (which we call ſeas) as well within, as about the ſame: for ſo it was neceſſarie that ſome partes of the earth might be vncouered, for the health and habitation of liuing creatures; ſo as it hath pleaſed the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne king of the world to ordaine for the benefit of all things.</p>
                  <p>There are then fower elements &amp; firſt foundations of things compounded, and ſubiect to corruption.<note place="margin">How the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fowre is note-woorthy in diuers things.</note> And by this number of fower perfectly conſonant, the elementarie world is diuided into theſe fower partes: the firie, the airie, the watrie, and the earthy part: ſo alſo is this terreſtriall frame diſtinguiſhed into fower points, to wit; Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, as we knowe the like to be in the celeſtiall bodies. And by their diuers moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and courſes we obtaine the fower ſeaſons of the yeere, to wit, the ſpring, ſommer, autumne, and winter. From whence likewiſe proceedeth all aide and fauor to the ſubſtance and compoſition of the creatures compriſed vnder theſe fower kindes, that is, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, vegetable, ſenſitiue, and reaſonable creatures, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of theſe fower qualities, hot, cold, moiſt, and drie. We likewiſe ſee that all quantitie is diuided into fower, to wit, into a point, into a length, bredth, and depth.

Moreouer if we will here drawe out ſome myſteries of the Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorians, we ſhall knowe, that all the foundation of euery deepe ſtudie and inuention, muſt be ſetled vpon the number of fower, bicauſe it is the roote and beginning of all numbers, which exceed fower. For a vnitie being ioined to a fower, maketh vp ten: and in this number all the reſt to ten are found: as may appeere in this
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8737:98"/>
figure [1. 2. 3. 4.] Aboue which number of ten (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his problemes, and <hi>Hierocles</hi> in his verſes vpon <hi>Pythagoras</hi> reciteth) no land, nor language hath euer proceeded. For the Hebrues, Greekes, Latins, and Barbarians themſelues being come ſo farre as to ten, begin againe with an vnitie; ſaying (11. 12.) and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, imitating nature guided by her ſoueraigne, who by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of tens parteth the fingers of the hands, and toes of the feete: as the ſame creator would diſtribute the terreſtriall, celeſtiall, and ſuperceleſtiall world by this number of ten, as the diuinitie of the Hebrues doth teach, and as we haue heretofore made mention. The which number likewiſe doth containe all manner of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be they euen, odde, ſquare, long, plaine, perfect, cubicall, pyramidall, prime, or compound numbers. And thereby, that is, by denarie proportions, fower cubicall numbers are accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo fower is the roote of ten, and ten of an hundred, and an hundred of a thouſand. For as 1. 2. 3. and 4. make ten: ſo by tens are hundreds made; and by hundreds, thouſands. Moreouer foure containeth all muſicall harmonie, bicauſe that therein is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion double, triple, quadruple, of ſo much and an halfe, and of ſo much &amp; a third: wherof reſulteth the diapaſon, the biſdiapaſon, diapente, diateſſeron, and diapaſon togither with diapente. For this cauſe <hi>Hierocles</hi> the interpreter of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> doth ſo extoll this number of fower, that he affirmeth it to be the cauſe of all things, and that nothing can be ſaid or done, which proceedeth not from it, as from the roote and foundation of all nature. And therfore did the Pythagorians ſweare by this number, as by ſome holy thing, making (as may be eaſily coniectured) alluſion to that great fower-lettered name of the Hebrues,<note place="margin">The name of God foure-lettered.</note> from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their inſtructions.

The naturaliſt alſo teacheth fower nurſes of nature, to wit, power, growth, the forme growne, and the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And the Mathematicians haue theſe fower elements, the point, the line, the plaine, and the ſolid. And that which the point
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8737:98"/>
is in the Mathematicks, the ſame is the ſeminarie power in the Phiſickes: the line is as the naturall growth: the plaine or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies as the forme perfect in greatnes, and the ſolide or cube, or deepe bodie, as the compoſition.

Artificers likewiſe accuſtome to ſettle their buildings vpon fower corners, to the end they may be firme and durable: wherein they imitate nature, which worketh ſo in all this world. And the ſoueraigne gouernor thereof hath willed, that there ſhould be fower foundations of the moſt perfect, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and firme law of grace, to wit, the fower Euangeliſts.<note place="margin">Agreement of the elements.</note> It then plainly appeereth, that not without great myſterie the creator ſetled fower foundations of all this mundane frame: which in admirable proportion doe accord togither, as al ſquare numbers, which are incloſed by a proper number, referre themſelues by a middle proportionall to both ſides. For (as we haue ſaid) the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are agreeable one to another, with their coupled qualities, whereof each retaineth one peculiar qualitie to it ſelfe, and agreeth in the other, as by a meane with the next element. So that the fower elements are (as if each one of them had two hands, by which they held one another) as in a round daunce: or elſe, as if they were conioined and linked togither, as with chains and buckles. And therefore the water is moiſt and cold, retaining the moiſture as peculiar to it ſelfe, and in coldnes participating with the nature of the earth: by the moiſture thereof, it is alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied vnto the aire; which alſo in ſome meaſure participateth in heate with the nature of fire. Wherefore as the earth accordeth in coldnes with the water; ſo is the water anſwerable in moiſture to the aire; and the aire is correſpondent in heate to the fire: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining yet neuertheles each of them one proper &amp; predominant qualitie. But aboue all, the Academicks haue inuented a goodly concord betweene theſe elements, in their diſcourſes of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple proportion; from which onely their muſicall proportions doe proceede: for if one paſſe farther, mens eares ſeeme to bee offended. They ſay then,<note place="margin">Of the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> that the fire is twiſe more ſubtile then the aire, thriſe more mooueable, and fower times more pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Likewiſe that the aire is twiſe more ſharpe then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thriſe more ſubtile, and fower times more mooueable.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:8737:99"/>
Againe that the water is twiſe more ſharpe then the earth, thriſe more ſubtile, and fower-times more mooueable. And in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion haue they found out the harmonie of the elements, and ſhewed, that though the fire be ſharpe, ſubtile, and mooueable; the aire ſubtile, mooueable, and moiſt; the water mooueable, moiſt, and corporall; the earth corporall, immooueable, and dry; yet is there a certaine accord and vnion betweene them: bicauſe that betwixt the fire and the earth, the aire and water haue been placed by ſuch a couenant, that there is the ſame reſpect betwixt the fire and the aire, that is betweene the aire and the water; and betweene the water and the earth: and againe, that ſuch as the earth is towards the water; ſuch is the water towards the aire, and the aire towards the fire, in correſpondencie of qualities, and harmonious contrarietie. Wherefore they conclude, that the harmonie is on all ſides ſo great among the elements, that it is no maruell if in their proper places, and in their compounds, they maintaine and repoſe themſelues with very great and friendly concord. Whereby it appeereth, that none can induce a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier reaſon, why the water doth not ouerflow the earth being higher then it; then to ſay, that it will not ſwarue from this agreement. But further concerning this matter, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe, which accept but of three elements; namely the aire, the water, and the earth; and reiect the elementary fire?

                     </gap>) that is, beginnings or elements, &amp; of thoſe proceedeth the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all corruptible things. And if probable arguments may ought preuaile, each one muſt acknowledge fower elements in all compound bodies, as the moſt part of thoſe, who haue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8737:99"/>
conſidered the workes of nature, are of opinion. Now there is none that can doubt of the earth, of the water, and of the aire, becauſe of their greatnes and huge extenſion ſeene by euery eie. But for the fire, we onely ſee the increaſe, the power, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple matter thereof, and his force or fountaine is eſteemed to be in the concauitie of the moone aboue the aire.<note place="margin">Of ſuch as ſay that there is no fire vnder the ſphere of the moone.</note> Yet ſome among the naturall Philoſophers affirme and maintaine, that there is no fire vnder the orbe of the moone: neither will acknowledge any other elementary fire, but the fires of the celeſtial bodies, and the heate of them, which they communicate to all the reſt of the creatures. And therefore they aſſigne to theſe fires all the ſpace, which is from the moone to the higheſt heauen. Saying more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that ſith the heauen is a thing moſt pure, it is not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to place a thing moſt burning vnder that which is exempt from all qualitie. For nature doth alwaies ioine extremities with things of meane qualitie: as is found betwixt the fleſh and the bones where ſhe hath placed a filme or thinne skinne; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the bones and the ligatures, ſhe hath put the griſtles: ſo betwixt the ſcull and the braine, becauſe it is ſofter then fleſh, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath placed two filmes, the hardeſt whereof is neereſt to the bone of the head. Thereupon then they conclude, that the aire is much fitter then the fire to bee next the heauens, and ſerue as a meane to ioine them with the earth and water. And againſt it they argue, that ſwiftnes of motion is the cauſe or argument of the heate, and that there is no other fire: others againe auouch, that this cannot be. For (ſay they) although that ſolide ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may by motion be heated (as ſtones, lead, and liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) yet thoſe which diſperſe or ſcatter themſelues abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby ſo much the colder, by how much they are more lightly mooued, witnes the aire and the water. For all ſtrong and ſwift windes are cold, and riuers that haue a quick courſe are very cold. Againe thoſe that denie the elementarie fire,<note place="margin">Reaſons of ſuch as deny the fire to enuiron the aire.</note> do bring this argument; to wit, that the comets and flames which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do appeere in the heauens, do cauſe in the aire verie great and as it were intollerable heates: Therefore they demand, what might happen if the vniuerſall world, eſpecially the elementarie, were enuironed by fire, who could hinder but that that fire would inflame the aire, and after it all other things, ſith the heate of the celeſtiall bodies would thereto giue aide? They adde how <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois</hi> doth eſteeme that all brightnes is hot, and that the aire is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:8737:100"/>
ſuch: and that euery moiſt qualitie doth leaſt of all other reſiſt heate. How then (ſay they) ſhall the aire reſiſt the fire which is the moſt vehement, and moſt ſharpe of all elements? It is true that this Arabicke author hath ſaid, that ſometimes the fire is not actually hot: but what then ſhall be his poſſibilitie? We ſay that ſome medicines are hot by poſſibilitie, becauſe that being taken they heat woondrouſly. But by what creatures ſhall the fire be deuoured, to the end to reduce it to the qualitie of medicines? Moreouer, if the fire be not hot, then is not the water cold: which ſhould be to confound al reaſon, and the very order of the world. Againe, they demand what it is that letteth the fire, that it ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, and that it is not ſeene in the elementarie region? Againe, if fire be in the aire, why then, the higher we mount, doe we finde the aire more cold, and why do ſnowes more abound on the mountaine tops, then in the loweſt places, yea vnder the torrid zone? Which neuertheleſſe might not ſeeme ſtrange, if one ſhould conſider, how ſnowe falleth in winter onely, and very colde haile in midſt of ſummer, the cauſe whereof we ſhall heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after diſcouer. But (ſay they) if one ſhould obiect that the higheſt places are fartheſt remote from the reuerberation of the ſunne: this may be an argument of leſſe heate, but not of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. In fine they adde, that if heate were in the higheſt of the aire in an elementary body, it ſhould principally there reſt, for to cauſe the generation of things. Now for this reaſon it cannot be there, conſidering that the celeſtiall heat is it that doth engender, as al Philoſophers maintaine. Thereupon they conclude, that this imagination of fire aboue the aire is vaine. It ſeemeth alſo that be a thing neuer ſo light, as is the fire; yet can it not mount ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high: and to ſay that it was caried aloft, onely coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo, and that the place thereof muſt be there, ſuch Rhetoricall arguments are not woorth rehearſing in ſerious matters.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anſwere to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons which are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prooue foure elements.</note>There are ſome alſo, which to the reaſons by vs before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the beginning of this ſpeech, do replie; that it ſeemeth they do not conclude that there be fower ſimple bodies, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrarie. For, for the firſt betwixt two extremes one meane (&amp; not two) is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly aſſigned: which being conſidered in regard of the elements, there ſhoulde onely be three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And for this vulgar opinion, that in all compound bodies there are eſteemed to bee fower elements; the heat which is in mixt and compound ſubſtances cannot conſiſt of elementarie
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8737:100"/>
fire: For if the fire ſhoulde remaine in them, it ſhould much more reſt in the herbe called (Euphorbium) and in Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which are of an extreme hot and drie nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one might more commodiouſly get fire out of them then out of moſt colde ſtones, which yet wee finde to bee cleane contrarie. Moreouer, the diſtillations wherein many ſtraine themſelues to ſearch the fower elements, doe demonſtrate but three ſubſtances onely, to wit, water for water, oile inſteed of aire, and the earth which is in the bottome. Now if that any do ſay that the reddeſt part of the oyle doth repreſent the fire, becauſe it is verie ſharpe and verie ſubtile, we will anſwere, that ſuch piercing ſharpnes of ſauour proceedeth from the vehement vertue of the fire, which operateth in the diſtillation. Which likewiſe doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeere in the oyle extracted from mettals: euerie part whereof is of a verie ſharpe ſauour. Wherefore if euerie thing of ſuch a qualitie repreſenteth the fire, it muſt follow of neceſſity, that in euerie ſuch eſſence no portion of aire may ſubſiſt. But all the world doth alleage, that there may fower humours be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to remaine in the bodies of all liuing creatures. And yet what auaileth that to prooue ſo many elements? Nay, what if I ſhould ſay with <hi>Thruſianus</hi> expounder of <hi>Galen</hi> vpon the art of Phiſicke; that there are but three humors only? But leaue we this diſputation, and let vs ſpeake of a more ſtrong and forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taken from the combinations and coniunctions of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie qualities which are in number fower, as we haue heard in our precedent diſcourſe. They alone then and apart doe not conſtitute an element; for they cannot haue the power to doe and to ſuffer: neither alſo can they conſiſt more then two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither; for elſe, contraries ſhould remaine in one ſelfe ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. Neither can heat be ioyned with cold without ſome meane, nor dry with moiſt: Whereupon doth follow that the qualities not contrarie, being ioyned two and two together, doe declare vnto vs fower well ordered combinations or couplings, which do argue vnto vs the fower elements. But hearken what the aduers part anſwereth: Such coniunctions and copulations doe onely ſhew themſelues in mixtures and compound bodies: for ſome things being hot in the firſt degree, are alſo moiſt; and ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, are drie: others are hot and drie; others cold and moiſt; and ſo conſquently of the reſt. But for the elements becauſe that heat and great drines had reduced all things to an ende, in ſteed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8737:101"/>
of miniſtring a beginning vnto them; Nature, or rather the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature,<note place="margin">Of the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all heat produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing fire.</note> hath ordayned a celeſtiall heat well tempered, by which all things ſhould be engendred: And by it, and by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and motion, the creature called Fire is inceſſantly produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Whereupon enſueth, that though there be a fire, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe it is no element: And therefore they conclude, that there are but three elements. The earth moſt thicke and heauie ſeated below: the aire moſt thin and light placed aboue: and the water meane betwixt theſe qualities ſituate between both. They alſo affirme, that vnto theſe elements it is common to haue no naturall heat: becauſe there is no heat, but from the heauens, and conſequently from the ſoule, and from brightnes: That the earth becauſe it is exceeding thicke and ſolide, and the aire, becauſe it is beyond meaſure thinne, ſeeme to be leaſt cold: but the water which is of meane ſubſtance betweene both, ſeemeth to be moſt cold. That the earth, becauſe of ſome certaine thinneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, admitteth heat: and therefore is eſteemed leſſe cold then ſtones. And the aire becauſe of the temperate cleernes, and for that by the thinneſſe thereof it is eaſily chaunged, is eſteemed not onely not to be cold, but to be hot, though in truth all the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are cold by their own nature. Which coldnes is nothing elſe, but priuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heat, which heat doth wholly reſt in the ſtars, &amp; which is a proper celeſtiall qualitie moouing the bodie, which aided by motion produceth fire. But (ſay they) many may bee deceiued by reaſon of the violent heat, which ſometimes maketh impreſſion in the elements. For by the action of the ſtarres, ſome parts of the elements are mixed and participate with the nature of the celeſtiall bodies, as Pepper becommeth hot: And yet ſuch mingling cannot be ſaid to be an element, but a thing compoſed partly of elements. And for the fire which lighteth by the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and beating of ſtones, that it is likewiſe an heat of the ſtars in a bodie rarified by the celeſtiall power. By theſe reaſons then they conclude, that two qualities do onely appeere vnto vs, the heat of heauen, and the proper moiſture of the elements: and as for drie and cold, that they be the priuations of thoſe qualities: and that therfore a thing verie hot, or verie cold cannot properly be called an element:<note place="margin">What an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</note> but that that may be ſaid to be an element, which hath no need of nouriſhment, which of it ſelfe is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, neither wandreth here and there, but retayneth a certaine place in great quantitie according to nature, and is prepared for
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:8737:101"/>
generation. All which things not agreeing with the fire, becauſe it is alwaies mooued, neither can ſubſiſt without nouriture; and burneth the aire which is next it, whereby being inflamed, it is called a flame (for flame is nothing elſe, but the aire inflamed:) it followeth that it cannot be called an element, but rather an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall and great heat. Behold then how Philoſophers do diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly diſpute vpon this matter: but our intention is not to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence therein, eſpecially againſt the ancient, and generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed opinion, which admitteth fower elements.

Now theſe fower elements do demonſtrate themſelues by the like number of perfect compounds,<note place="margin">The agreement of ſtones with the earth.</note> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the nature of them: to wit, by ſtones, mettals, plants, and animals or ſenſitiue creatures.

Chryſtall and the Beryll are alſo numbred among ſtones: becauſe that though they may be engendred of water, they are neuertheleſſe ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed and in manner frozen, that being made earthie they deſcend downewards; which is not the manner of froſt and ſnow. So is it with thoſe ſtones that are bredde in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, though they be produced of a waterie humour. And all
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8737:102"/>
theſe kindes of ſtones become ſo cloſe and ſolide in their nature, with ſuch faſtnes and binding, that they cannot be molten like mettals: although the ſaide mettals deſcend downewardes like ſtones.<note place="margin">Mettals agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the water.</note> And therefore alſo vpon the ſecond watrie angle of the elementarie world, mettals are builded: which though they be ſaid to be compoſed of all the elements, yet bicauſe they are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally made of water, they retaine the nature thereof, and will melt, as <hi>Abubacher</hi> doth excellently diſcourſe, ſpeaking thus: [We ſee in mines, that by reaſon of the continuall heate of ſome mountaines, the thickeſt of the water ſteweth and boileth ſo, that in tract of time it becommeth quickſiluer. And of the fat of the earth ſo ſtewed and boiled togither with heate, is brimſtone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, and through continuall heate alſo are mettals procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For gold that hath no default is ingendred of quickſiluer, and of brimſtone that is pure, tough, cleere, and red. Siluer of the ſame liquid ſiluer, and of cloſe, pure, cleere and white ſulphur; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in colour wanteth, and ſomething of the cloſenes &amp; ſurenes, and conſequently of waight. Tinne, that is more vnperfect, is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the ſame cauſes, and parts vnperfect, bicauſe they are leſſe concocted and attenuated. Lead, of the ſame terreſtriall-ſiluer, and full of filth, depriued of purenes and ſurenes: and of groſſe ſulphur or brimſtone ſomewhat red, whereto wanteth faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, clearnes, and waight: which makes this mettall vnperfect and impure. And Iron is procreated of the ſame quickſiluer, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, tough, part earthie and burnt, white, and not cleere: which maketh this mettall baſe and foule, failing in purenes and in waight. All which mettals being made of quickſiluer, which is waterie, doe (for this cauſe) retaine the nature of the water.] To this author accordeth <hi>Auicen</hi> in his Phiſickes, and in the epiſtle to <hi>Hazem</hi> the philoſopher. But <hi>Gilgil</hi> the Spanyard ſuppoſed that mettals had been engendred of cinders, bicauſe they ſinke in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and melt like the glaſſe, which is drawne from terreſtriall-cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and beaten ſtone. But this concludeth not: for mettall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and deſcendeth, by reaſon of that terreſtriall part which it hath incorporated with the liquid part, and bicauſe that the pores which retaine the aire, are cloſed and ſhut vp. And for glaſſe, it is not extracted out of the earthie matter, but out of the radicall moiſture, which is within the cinders and ſtones. For in euery compound are the fower elements, though the nature of one hath more domination therein. For this cauſe likewiſe plants are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8737:102"/>
founded vpon the third angle of the world, called airie:<note place="margin">Concord of the plants with the aire.</note> for they doe not growe nor fructifie, but in open day, and doe properly retaine the nature of the aire, which they alwaies require, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitteſt and apteſt for them. Yea the wood it ſelfe would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently corrupt and rot, being depriued of the aire, if the watrie humor doe not ſuccour it, which participateth with the aire. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally vpon the fourth angle of this fower-faced edifice, to wit,<note place="margin">Animals accord with the fire.</note> vpon the fire, is the liuing ſenſitiue creature built, whoſe life (as many learned doe teach) is by meanes of fire, and obtained from the Empyreall heauen, and from the ſpirit of life, which is a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire, and diſtributeth life to all the mundane wheeles: as we may learne by the oracles of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1.</note> [And the ſpirit of life was in the wheeles.] Behold then, how vpon the fower baſes of the elements are planted fower ſorts of perfect compounds, to wit, ſtones, mettals, plants, and liuing creatures.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that vnder euery vniuerſall kinde of theſe, there are diuers particular ſpecies diſtinct the one from the other: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſtones may be properly earthie, yet are they ſometimes nominated of ſome other element, which moſt preuaileth in their compoſition. For doubtleſſe all the elements doe meete togither in the procreation of them, but chiefly earth and water. Whereupon obſcure and thicke-darke ſtones are called earthie-ſtones; and cleere tranſparent ſtones, waterie;<note place="margin">Diuerſitie of the nature of ſtones.</note> and ſome alſo are melted by a great fire, to be turned into glaſſe. Some alſo with raine falling drop by drop are engendred in the ſhels of oiſters; as thoſe pearles which are found in the Indian and Britaine ſeas. The chryſtal and Beryll are made of water frozen, voide of pores or ſubtile paſſages, ſo that they can neither receiue heate nor be melted. It appeereth alſo, that there is fire in the compoſition of ſtones, which likewiſe is forced out of the flint being ſtroken with a gad of ſteele. To which purpoſe <hi>Hermes</hi> amongſt his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets teacheth, that a ſtone doth ſometimes ſpring out of the fire, mounting from earth to heauen, and then againe returning to the earth, that nouriſhed it. For mettals likewiſe,<note place="margin">Diuerſitie of the mettals.</note> though they be waterie, ſome of them doe neuertheles retaine the nature of fire, as gold and iron, one of which imitateth the fire of the ſunne, and the other the fire of <hi>Mars.</hi> But tinne and copper are airie, this receiuing influence from <hi>Venus,</hi> that from <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Siluer agreeth with the moone, Lead with <hi>Saturne,</hi> quickſiluer with <hi>Mercurie:</hi> and yet all of them are endued with a waterie nature, &amp; wil melt,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8737:103"/>
and doe differ in waight. For as one water doth differ in waight from another; ſo doth mettall from mettall, not onely in ſpeciall, but alſo in vndiuiſible proportion. For common gold differeth in waight from that which the Latines call <hi>(Obryſum)</hi> or elſe <hi>(Ofiry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zum)</hi> of the Hebrue word <hi>(Ofir)</hi> which we call (fine golde) and which hath been oftentimes purged and refined in the fire, and waſteth not therein. The gold of Tharſis alſo doth differ from the gold of India and Hungarie, and ſo of others. So likewiſe doe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters differ in goodnes and in waight, according to the region and place wherein they are: and by how much they are neerer to the fountaine, by ſo much are they better and lighter. And by their waight (as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> will haue it) one may knowe the goodnes of the aire: according to which he willeth men to chooſe out places to build houſes in. Concerning plants, although they may be by nature airie,<note place="margin">A different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the plants.</note> yet there are ſome, whoſe rootes, iuice, leaues, and bloſſomes are ſaid to be hot in the firſt, ſecond, third, or fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and others are cold and drie; ſome alſo are moiſt: which diuerſitie happeneth, according as the plant obtaineth more or leſſe of the nature of one of the elements.<note place="margin">Diuerſitie of nature in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malibus.</note> The like is of liuing creatures. For though they may properly be ſaid to be of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fire, yet are there ſome, which being more earthie, delight in the earth, as mowles, woormes, and commonly all creeping things. Likewiſe all fiſhes are nouriſhed by the water: the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon by the aire: the ſalamander by fire, as ſome affirme, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he long time indureth fire through his exceſſiue cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. There are ſome alſo which burne with great heate, as doues and lions: ſome are cooled with moiſture, as the lambe; and ſome are dry, as hares and deere. But neuertheleſſe in regarde of their life they are all eſpecially of the nature of fire diſtinguiſhed by degrees: wherefore diuers names haue beene aſſigned to them, being borrowed from the elements or from their qualities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the celeſtiall and ſupercele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall elements.</note>And beſides all this which we haue heere diſcourſed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the elements, which may bee found in the perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſubſtances of this elementarie world, many learned men affirme, that they are alſo reſident in the celeſtiall and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceleſtiall world. But that as they are heere thicke and groſſe: ſo by a contrary reaſon they are pure and cleane in heauen, and in it liuing and euery where well doing. They ſay then, that theſe celeſtiall elements are as the woorthieſt &amp; excellent portion of thoſe, which ſubſiſt vnder the moones-ſphere in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,

and which remaine alſo in the bowels of the earth as the moſt baſe and groſſe lees of the elements. And that in heauen they are certaine vertues or powers; and in nature the ſeedes of things; and in the world below groſſe formes. For (as they argue) if there were no elementarie powers in heauen, how then by the celeſtiall influences ſhould theſe elements heere below be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred and transformed: in ſuch ſort as that which now is aire may be conuerted into raine, the water exhaled into aire, the earth turned into wood, which nouriſheth the fire, and from the wood riſeth aire, and aſhes fal, which is earth? For theſe cauſes alſo it is very likely that the Aſtronomers diſtinguiſh the ſignes of the Zodiack and the Planets by the elements, attributing three ſignes to euery of them, as we haue already declared. But we ſhal finde enough to content vs concerning this matter, when we diſcourſe particularly as touching the firme concord which remaineth betwixt the terreſtriall elements and the Planets.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the celeſtiall ſpheres doe follow that vniuerſall &amp; common courſe which the firſt heauen that contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and encloſeth them all doth begin, beſide the motions that are proper &amp; peculiar to each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as we haue alreadie heeretofore declared:) ſo muſt we in like ſort note, that the elements do follow the heauens, &amp; obſerue an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after them, euery one in his degree, hauing their motions alſo agreeable to their nature. And that likewiſe there is betwixt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8737:104"/>
them and the celeſtiall bodies, a certaine accord and anſwerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of powers and qualities aptly proportioned by degrees, euen as is found in all creatures compounded of them. We will then firſt entreat of this agreement betwixt the elements and the heauens;<note place="margin">Agreeablenes of the earth with the moone.</note> beginning with the earth, which is correſpondent to the moone in diuers reſpects. For as the earth draweth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to it, and ſoketh it vp, in ſuch ſort that it is numbred by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amongſt thoſe things which are neuer ſatisfied, to wit, with water: ſo doth the moone with a perpetuall attraction draw the water, making it ſometimes to riſe, to wit, when from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Horizon ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the midſt of heauen, from whence deſcending to the occidentall Horizon ſhe carieth it away with her with ſuch violence, that it ſeemeth to flie from vs. Againe, when the moone runneth in the point oppoſite to the midde heauen, ſhe draweth the water away with her; then returning againe to the eaſterne Horizon, ſhe cauſeth it to follow after her in like ſort. When ſhe encreaſeth alſo ſhe draweth vp the humors in trees and mens bodies; when ſhe waineth, ſhe chaſeth them downe. Againe, the earth and moone do agree in the firſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of cold and drie, wherewith the earth is actually, and the moone operatiuely repleniſhed, which alſo (according to her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being ſomewhat terreſtriall) doth ſuppe vp the celeſtiall waters, and all the influences of the bodies aboue her, which as neereſt to vs, ſhe doth communicate with vs. For ſhe receiueth from the other planets, and principally from the ſunne, that which ſhe diſtributeth heere below. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> in his Banquet ſaith,<note place="margin">The moone and earth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in variety.</note> That the moone participateth with the ſunne and with the earth. Moreouer, the moone is ſingular in varietie: whence it commeth to paſſe, that one while ſhe is crooked with hornes, another time diuided into equall proportions or halues; then being full round, ſhe is here and there beſpotted: ſomtimes ſhe ſeemeth vnmeaſurably great in hir round fulneſſe; preſently after ſhe appeereth very ſmall: now ſhe ſheweth very faire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north; afterwards againe ſhe is couched in the ſouth: ſo within a few daies ſhe ſubmitteth hir ſelfe to coniunction, and by and by is ſhe full and big; preſently after ſhe is deliuered of the fruit, which ſhe had conceiued. Now in this great changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes, the moone doth ſhew vs that the earth is like vnto hir. For now being diſrobed of hir ornaments, ſhe appeereth blacke: afterwards being painted and adorned with herbes and flowers,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8737:104"/>
ſhe ſeemeth very faire. One part thereof is ſtonie, another part is mariſh. In one place it is leane, in another place fat; here abaſed in vallies, there lift vp in mountaines: here fertile, &amp; yonder bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. One part is checkered with diuers ſpots, this red, that blacke, one white, &amp; another browne. One portion is cloſe and clammie; another thinne and ſandie. Moreouer the earth is ſometimes void and emptie, and then ſhe receiueth the coniunction of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, whereby in ſhort ſpace being filled, ſhe bringeth foorth fruit. So then the moone amongſt the ſtars, and the earth amongſt the elements doe agree in many particulars.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching the water,<note place="margin">The water cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to mercury.</note> it ſeemeth to be anſwerable to <hi>Mercurie</hi> and to <hi>Saturne</hi> alſo. For the order of the planets, and the correſpondencie which they haue to things here belowe, did require, that next after the earthly moone, waterie <hi>Mercurie</hi> ſhould be ſituate, whome poets haue named (the Arbiter or vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier of the waters) then followeth next airie <hi>Venus,</hi> and after hir the ſunne, which is of the nature of fire. Then againe <hi>Mars</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating of the ſame force, hath his ſeate next aboue the ſunne: airian <hi>Iupiter</hi> aboue <hi>Mars:</hi> wateriſh <hi>Saturne</hi> ouer <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and the ſigne-bearing heauen aboue <hi>Saturne,</hi> as anſwering to the earth; then higher againe is the firſt mooueable, of the nature of fire. It is certaine that the nature of <hi>Mercurie</hi> is by ſo much more hard to be deciphered, by how much his ſtarre is more hidden and harde to be ſeene, and that very ſeldome too. And therefore doe Aſtronomers affirme, that his influent power is ſecrete, by reaſon that hee eaſily accepting the nature of the planet wherewith hee is conioyned, or of the ſigne wherein hee is reſident, ſeemeth to operate, not according to his owne proper nature, but as the executor of the influence of another. Whereupon he is by them nominated <hi>(Hermes)</hi> to ſignifie, that he is as it were interpretor of the other ſtars intendements. For by the teſtimonie of <hi>Ptolemie,</hi> he drieth vp being with the Sunne; he cooleth with the Moone; hee fauoureth the vnderſtanding with Saturne; he beſtoweth aduiſe &amp; policie in warlike affaires, where ſtoutnes is required, with Mars: and conioyned to Venus, he engendreth the<note n="*" place="margin">One that is of both ſexes.</note> Anerogyne or Hermaphrodite: which muſt be vnderſtood concerning him, who exerciſeth ſubtiltie of wit, which he receiueth from Mercurie, in the ſecond, Venus, which is diſordinate. For ſuch a man is effeminate, retayning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of both ſexes. So that Mercurie agreeing with the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8737:105"/>
diſcourſe and fauouring the ſame, as he is turned towards the ſuperiour ſtars, or elſe towards the inferiour; he likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth diuers effects, in ſo much that his propertie cannot eaſily be comprehended. And yet may he verie aptly be ſaid to be of the nature of water, as many Philoſophers are of opinion, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the order of the planets requireth (to obſerue the harmonie and league of things heere below with thoſe aboue) that he ſhould be watrie. Moreouer, as water doth in waſhing, take away the ſpot that couereth, in ſuch ſort that the naked bare forme doth appeere: ſo Mercurie contributing fauour to the promptnes and ſubtiltie of mens wits, is to them as an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, taking away the vaile from ſtrange languages, obſcurenes from riddles and parables, and difficultie from euerie profound and myſticall ſpeech: and opening that which is ſhut vp in the ſecret cabinets of God and nature, preſenteth the naked truth to be contemplated. Neither muſt we thinke that the ſtarre of Mercurie performeth this, but ſo far as it may operate in bodies by diſpoſing, or elſe as an inſtrument of the diuine omnipotency, as we haue heretofore declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Concordance of the aire with Venus.</note>Let vs now ſpeake of the aire. It ſeemeth to be anſwerable in nature to <hi>Venus,</hi> which is hot and moiſt: And by the foreſaid or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the planets ſucceſſion in courſe, that it muſt be referred to <hi>Iupiter.</hi> For this cauſe the Aſtronomers haue dedicated to <hi>Venus</hi> the airie liuing creatures. For euen as the aire &amp; winde coupleth and conioyneth things ſeuered, ſo doth the Venerian power: whereupon we will note, that the Academicks taught how that there were two Venuſes, the one Etherian, and the other Aërian: the higheſt, cleaneſt, chaſteth, and moſt temperate according with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and conioyning the ſuperiour, diuine and ſpirituall things: the loweſt, moſt diſordinate, ſlipperie, variable, and laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious, which conioyneth in luſt the creatures here below. Of this Venus ſo many ribauldries are ſung by wanton Poets, becauſe ſhe is cauſe of all euill; euen as the other is cauſe of all good. To which ſpeech the ſaying of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath relation: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that two loues haue made two cities. For the well diſpoſed and good loue of God, and the loue of one neighbour to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of ones ſelfe, hath edified the citie of God. But the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe loue of ones ſelfe, to the forgetting of God, hath reared vp the citie of the diuell. Moreouer, the Grammarians deliuer this reaſon, why the power of this ſtarre is called Venus: becauſe it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8737:105"/>
doth concur in all things, be they good or euill. And ſurely all is filled with loue, and nothing is void thereof, as all things are full of aire, which filleth the naturall appetite that abhorreth empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. By loue (ſaith <hi>Boëtius</hi>) are the heauens conioyned, and the elements agree with bodies compounde. Through it creatures dwell together, the citie is preſerued, and the common wealth increaſed. Through loue God made the world, and doth gouerne it: and the ſumme of all that, which he requireth of vs, is loue. Saint <hi>Denis</hi> in his Hierarchie ſpeaketh thus. [The loue of God hath not permitted that the king of all things ſhould remaine in himſelfe without fruit. And as through loue he is ſpread abroad in all things without himſelfe; ſo hee delighteth to attract all things to himſelfe, and principally man, in whom all is encloſed. And therefore when he ſhall be vnited (with God) euen ſo ſhall all other things be. Whether then that we ſpeake of diuine or angelicall, or ſpirituall, or quickning, or naturall loue, we meane a power engraffed, and conioyning, which mooueth the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things to prouidence and care, for the good of the inferiour, diſpoſeth equall things in a ſociable communion, and in fine admoniſheth inferiour things, that they turne themſelues to thoſe that are better and ſuperiour.] Thus ſpeaketh this great Doctor and Philoſopher. But let vs purſue the ſubiect of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. We haue declared, that the Academicks haue taught a double Venus. The like may be ſaid of the Aire, for we conſider it in two parts, the one thicke and foggie, which is next the earth; and the other pure and aetherian next vnto the ſtars: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heated by force of the winde which mixeth it ſelfe in all things, ſeemeth to be verie fit for the propagation and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of nature: for which reaſon alſo the winde and the aire are called by one name of the Hebrewes, who call all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their properties.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the elementarie fire is anſwerable to the Sunne,<note place="margin">That the fire agreeth with the ſunne.</note> and to Mars, who are both of the nature of fire. For as the Sunne is the true and celeſtiall fire, boyling all that which appertaineth to the viands of this great animall the world; ſo this elementarie fire cauſing all things to boyle by his great heat, doth perfect the nouriſhment of creatures liuing in the earth. Both the one and other fire heateth; but this driuing the humours inward, and the other drawing them out. This imparteth his commoditie to that onely, which is neere it; but the ſuperiour beſtoweth his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8737:106"/>
vertue vpon the fartheſt remote bodies, in ſuch ſort that the force of his beames pierceth euen to the bowels of the earth, where it boyleth and maketh mettals, which afterward the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie fire purgeth. Moreouer, as <hi>Apollo</hi> (ſo named) as of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is a priuatiue letter in compoſition, and of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth multitude, as being he, who alone contayneth the power of the heauens and of the ſtarres; or elſe becauſe that his vertue and power conſiſteth of many fires, by which he giueth light to all the ſtars, whoſe naturall vigour produceth not their effects, till ſuch time as they bee filled with the powerfull ſeed of this faire <hi>Phebus,</hi> who is ſo called of his beauty &amp; amiablenes which ſhineth in him, as he is alſo named <hi>Sol,</hi> as ſoly-ſhining; or elſe by a name amongſt the Hebrewes, which one may interpret: That which properly doth ſubſiſt, becauſe that the light and benefit thereof is proper and peculiar vnto him.] As this faire planet (I ſay) was acknowledged by the ancient Poets and Philoſophers, for the inuentor of phiſicke, becauſe of the quickning heat &amp; well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power thereof: ſo the fire heere beneath doth aptly pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne him, by reaſon that heating the cold frozen creatures, it doth in a manner reſtore their life vnto them. So it is heate that giueth life and fruitfulnes. For egges are not conuerted into chickens, nor the ſilkeworme into a butterflie, neither do plants grow, nor yet are liuing creatures nouriſhed and warmed, except either by the ſuperior, or by the quickning, or by the elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heat, which by a certaine ſympathie do ſeeme to bee of one ſelfe-ſame kinde, as it were through a correſpondencie. Yea the fire is ſo fruitefull, that it engendreth it ſelfe, and giueth power to other naturall things to engender, not by the heate thereof onely, but by the force of the light, which it receiueth from him who hath ſaid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1.</note> [I am the light of the world.] Wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> being deſirous to make manifeſt, that all things had beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the benefite of the light after that the matter which he calleth earth turned out of darknes, was made, he ſaith that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the light was created: as that by meanes of which life and forme muſt be giuen to all things, and aptnes to be ſeene. Which vitall vigor did no doubt conſiſt in the diuine fire which is called (the ſpirit of life) the which reſting vpon the face of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, infuſed into all things the life and the formes, by which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing might be diſcerned from other. But let vs now returne to our elementarie world, and particularly behold the nature of

                  <p>MAny Philoſophers doe diuide all that, which ſubſiſteth vnder the concaue of the Moone, into three parts: one of which they call the higheſt, the other the middle, and the third the loweſt part. The higheſt they place aboue the middle region of the aire, and make as it were the ſame element partaker with the moſt pure fire, which the ancients nominated (Aether) becauſe that there the elements are pure, ſubtile, thin, &amp; rare, and for that the aire there is very temperate and cleere, agreeing with the nature of heauen: as to the contrarie in the lower part, which is that where we inhabite, there is not any ſincere element (for a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble element is not pure) but all things are there compounded and mixed with the muddie and groſſe part of this mundane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And concerning the middle region of the aire, it is that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie place where the meteors and high impreſſions do appeere. So then aboue, the elements are pure: beneath, the perfect &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed bodies do faile, by reaſon of their mixture of the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſimplicitie: &amp; in the middle they compound themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, in ſuch ſort, that one may ſay that they poſſeſſe the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle place betwixt the nature of the elements and of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. Now as we haue ſaid before, and as the common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of people is, the heauen is often taken for this ſupreme and middle region of the aire, and for the things which are to them conioined, and do depend vpon their effects.<note place="margin">Of the things conioyned and depending vpon the effectes of the fire and of the aire.</note> So that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we may vnderſtand firſt two of the fower elements, to wit, the aire and the fire; then all things ingendred in them, and by them; as windes, thunders, lightnings, haile, whirle-windes,

cloudes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.</note> tempeſts, raine, dewes, froſts, ſnowes and all kinds of fire and ſuch like, which ariſe and appeere in the aire. And therein we may alſo compriſe all the creatures which conuerſe in it, as birds and all creatures that flie, euen as the holy Scripture teacheth vs, when it maketh mention of the birds of heauen.</p>
                  <p>Now the element of fire is knowne to haue his place neereſt to the moone, being by nature hot and dry; and is for this cauſe lighteſt, hauing his motion quicker then all the elements, bicauſe that lightnes and quicknes is proper to theſe two qualities (heat and drines) and therefore alſo the propertie thereof is to mount alwaies vpwards,<note place="margin">Of the proper nature of the fire, and of the aire.</note> vntill that it hath attained to the place deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto it, being moſt conuenient for the nature thereof, and which ioineth next vnto the ſpheres. Next the fire the aire poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the ſecond place, and agreeth in nature with the fire, in that it is hot: but is contrarie thereto in that it is alſo moiſt. And therefore the motion thereof followeth that of the fire, but it is not ſo light and quicke by reaſon of the humiditie, which maketh it more heauie and ſlow.<note place="margin">That the aire is alwaies mooued.</note> And yet it appeereth that it is alwaies mooued, bicauſe that in narrow places ſmall winds doe blow without ceaſing. For conſidering that the aire hath the motion thereof tending alwaies vpwards, and that it is continually moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vp and downe, it bloweth in a great ſpace very gently: but paſſing through a creuiſſe or ſtreight place, all the violence thereof being drawne togither by reaſon of the narrownes of the place, driueth out &amp; flieth vehemently vpon vs: after the maner of the waters of great flouds, which, when it ſeemeth that they can ſcarce flowe, being vrged through a narrow place, or through ſluces, are conſtrained to runne out by much force, with noiſe and roring. Moreouer according as the aire is mooued, either by the heate of the ſunne, or by the vapors and exhalations which this heat cauſeth to riſe out of the waters, and out of the earth, or by the waues of the ſea, or by the caues of the earth and ſuch like cauſes,<note place="margin">What winde is.</note> we perceiue the aire diuerſly agitated. For we muſt note that the windes are nothing elſe but the aire, which is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and driuen more violently then ordinarie, and which hath his motion more ſodaine, more violent and ſtrong; being driuen and preſſed forwards according as the cauſes are more great or ſmall, and according to the places from whence they proceed. And this is the reaſon why the aire is ſometimes ſo peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that one cannot feele ſo much as one onely ſmall puffe of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:8737:107"/>
winde: but it is as calme as the ſea, when it is not toſſed with any winde or tempeſt. As is euident by thoſe vanes and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thercocks which are ſet in the tops of turrets and houſes: for when the winde bloweth not, their plates are nothing mooued: and yet the aire doth neuer faile to blowe by reaſon of the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall motion thereof: but inſomuch as it is not hoiſed vp and downe, it paſſeth and flieth lightly away, without any noiſe or bruite towards that part whereto we ſee the point of the vane enclined.<note place="margin">Of the diuerſity of the windes, and of the order and boundes of them.</note> Sometimes alſo one may feele ſome ſmall pleaſant and gentle winde to blowe without any violence, which is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable, recreatiue, and profitable, not onely in regard of men and other liuing things, but in reſpect alſo of all the fruits of the earth. At another time likewiſe the violence of the windes is ſo great, that it raiſeth vp whirle-windes, ſtormes and tempeſtes, which driue the aire with ſuch fury and roughnes, that it ſeemeth they would ouerthrow and confound heauen and earth togither, beating downe and carying away all that is before them: like a great deluge and water-floud, which beareth away with it all that it meets with. But though one may ſuppoſe ſo during ſuch tempeſts, yet the courſe of the windes are not ſo confuſed, but that all of them obſerue their order and certaine places, out of which they iſſue and proceed, and their bounds likewiſe whereat they ſtay, and wherein they are confined, as the element of which they are engendred. And therefore by experience we ſee, that they follow the courſe of the Sunne, and that they are diſtributed, and diſpoſed according to all the partes of the world, as we vſually diuide it, hauing reſpect to the moouing of the ſpheres. For as we diuide the courſe of the ſunne, and all the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth into Eaſt, Weſt, North and South; ſo muſt we conſider the fower principall winds, which proceede out of theſe fower places one oppoſite to another. Beſides which there are certaine others which are called collaterall windes, bicauſe that each of the firſt hath them vpon the one or other ſide of them, ſo that thoſe who haue ordinarily written concerning the windes, doe appoint to the number of twelue common and ordinarie windes; ſaying alſo, that there are others which are proper to certaine regions and countries, according to the nature of their ſituations and places: as we may hereafter finde matter ynough thereof amply to intreat.</p>
                  <p>But here it will be good to touch one difficultie, which may
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8737:108"/>
be alledged vpon our diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Notable things in the diuerſitie of the qualities of the windes and of the aire.</note> touching that which we haue ſaid concerning the qualities of the aire. For ſith that it is hot and moiſt by nature, and that the windes are nothing elſe but the ſame are mooued and puffed forwards: what may be the cauſe that the windes doe not all of them retaine the nature of the aire? For we knowe by experience, that there are as many diuers qualities in the windes, as in all the elements: for ſome are hot and drie; others hot and moiſt; others moiſt and cold; and ſome cold and drie. Hereupon then we are to note, that all creatures which ſubſiſt of a ſenſible and corporall nature are commonly diuided into two kindes, which compriſe them all. The one are ſimple, and the other compound; of the firſt ſort are the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken euery one alone in their proper and particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch as we haue already declared. And all other creatures compounded of all the elements conioined togither, are of the ſecond kinde. Wherefore if the elements were pure, not any way mixed one with another, then would each of them retaine their naturall qualities purely. But bicauſe they are intermingled one with another, they haue their qualities likewiſe mingled. And therefore by how much the higher the aire mounteth, by ſo much the more it is pure, neat, ſubtile and thin; and by how much the lower it deſcendeth and approcheth the water and earth, by ſo much the more it is groſſe and thicke, and partaketh more of the elements neere to which it remaineth. And according as it is warmed by the heate of the ſunne, or by any other heate, or elſe as it is cooled by the abſence and default thereof; euen ſo doth it become either more hot, or more cold. The like alſo may be ſaid concerning the naturall moiſture thereof. For according as it is more or leſſe mixed with water, or neere vnto it; ſo doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue either a more moiſt, or a more drie qualitie. So therfore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the places out of which the windes proceed &amp; iſſue, and through which they paſſe, they are hotter or colder; drier or moiſture; pure or impure; healthfull and holeſome, or peſtilent and infectious, yea euen ſtinking. And for the ſame cauſe alſo it commeth to paſſe, that as the diuerſitie of lands and countries is diſpoſed, ſo winds, which are felt in one place warme, are in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place cold: and ſo is it of their moiſture and drines. By the ſame reaſon alſo thoſe that are healthfull for ſome, are vnhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for others; and thoſe which bring with them faire and cleere weather in one place, doe in another place bring raine and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:8737:108"/>
For the propertie of ſome of them is, according to the countries wherein they blowe, to chaſe away the cloudes, and to make the aire cleere, and the weather faire: whereas others doe aſſemble and heape them togither. Whereupon enſueth, that ſome bring raine with them, others ſnowe, and others againe haile and tempeſts, according as God hath ordained the cauſes in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the ſequele of our diſcourſe ſhall miniſter occaſion againe to ſpeake of. Wherefore purſuing the order of our ſpeech, we will conſider thoſe things which are conioyned to the fire and aire, and doe depend vpon their effects: as are thunders and lightnings. Whereof (ARAM) doe you diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>THere is a certaine vniuerſall loue and appetite in all creatures, which inciteth them all to loue their owne kinde, to deſire it, and to ſearch after it. But as their natures are diuers, euen ſo is the loue and the appetite which is in them. And therefore there are as many ſortes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as there are diuerſities of natures. And thence it is that the fire and the aire doe naturally deſire the higheſt places, and doe thither tend euermore, as the water and the earth doe require the loweſt, and doe thereto deſcend inceſſantly: neither can theſe elements finde any ſtay or reſt vntill they be arriued at thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are appointed vnto them by nature. And therefore what hinderance ſoeuer there may be, yet euery thing doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſeeke to returne to his naturall home, and therein doth all poſſible endeuour. Now here we are to conſider the cauſe of thunders, lightnings, tempeſts, earthquakes, and ſuch like moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and perturbations in the elements. For all theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, when the creatures, which by their contraries are hindered from purſuing their owne kinde, do fight with thoſe which keepe them backe, as if there were open warre betwixt them. Which cauſeth that that which by force can make way doth at laſt van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh. But bicauſe of the reſiſtance which there is, this cannot be performed without great violence, and maruellous noiſe: from whence proceede many admirable effects, and namely thunder, which hath miniſtred occaſion to many great ſpirits to ſearch out
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8737:109"/>
the cauſes ſomewhat neerely. But mens opinions, as in a very deepe matter are diuers hereupon.<note place="margin">Of the cauſes of thunder.</note> For ſome maintaine, that thunder is cauſed by the blowes and ſtrokes that the fire maketh being incloſed within the cloudes, which it cleaueth, ſo making it ſelfe to appeere as is ſeene in lightnings. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Meteors writeth, that thunder groweth and proceedeth of hot and drie exhalations aſcending out of the earth into the ſupreme region of the aire, being there repulſed backe by the beames of the ſtars into the cloudes. For theſe exhalations deſiring to ſet themſelues at libertie, and to free themſelues, doe cauſe this noiſe, which is often ſtopped by nature, whileſt they fight with the cloudes: but when they can gaine iſſue, then doe they make the cloude to cracke, like a bladder full of winde that is broken by force. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer <hi>Plinie</hi> imitating the opinion of the Epicure teacheth,<note place="margin">Plin. hiſt. natur. lib. 2.</note> that thoſe fires, which fall from the ſtarres (as we ſee often in calme weather) may ſometimes meete with the cloudes, and fall vpon them, and that by the vehemencie of this blowe the aire is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And that this fire plunging it ſelfe into the cloudes cauſeth a certaine thicke and hiſſing ſmoke, which maketh a noiſe like an hot iron thruſt into water: From whence the whirlewindes which we ſee in the aire doe proceede. But when the winde or vapour incloſed in the cloudes, will needes get out by force, then this cauſeth thunder. And if there come out fire which breaketh the cloud, then is it lightning. But when theſe inflamed vapours doe ſhew foorth a long traine of their fire out of the cloud, then this is that which we call a flaſh of lightning. Whereupon enſueth that theſe lightning-flaſhes cleaue the cloudes: but the fire of thunder teareth and renteth them, and cauſeth them to cracke.</p>
                  <p>But referring theſe arguments to Philoſophers, we may fitly ſay, that the true cauſe of thunder is the winde incloſed, which ſeeketh to iſſue out.<note place="margin">Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of heat.</note> But that which is moſt admirable therein, is the great violence of the flaſhes thereof, &amp; the ſtrange accidents which happen by the fire thereof. For it doth not onely pierce more then any other fire, by reaſon of the paſſing ſwift motion thereof: but it is much hotter then all other fire. For it is to be noted that there is a difference in heate; and that not onely by reaſon of the matter one fire is hotter then another, as that which is in the iron is hotter then that which is in ſtraw; and that which is in oken wood is hotter then that which is in willow: but euen as in ice we find ſome ſcarcely frozen, otherſome hard; and other
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8737:109"/>
againe very hard: ſo is there in fire that is ſcarce fire, as when the iron beginneth to waxe ſomewhat red, and another fire that is ſhining, and other that ſhines very bright. Wherefore we muſt note that fire exceeds in heate and in force ſixe manner of waies. 1. By nature as I haue ſaid (for the moſt ardent burneth quickeſt and ſooneſt.) 2. By the ſoliditie of the matter (as that which is in iron:) 3. By motion, (for therby it is made more pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.) 4. By greatnes either proper to it ſelfe, or cauſed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, (which is common to euery fire.) 5. By hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of reſpiration, and by conſtraint togither, (as is manifeſt in lyme, which is kindled with water; for the heate being gotten in, and hid in the fornace, being of the kinde of fire, is encloſed and gathered within the lyme, ſo that it returneth into fire, by the motion and mixture of the water.) Now the conſtrained motion muſt not onely penetrate very much, but alſo it enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth heat, and (as I haue declared) it maketh one fire hotter then another. And therefore it may be no great woonder,<note place="margin">Of the violence and force of thunder.</note> if the lightning of thunder be of very much force and violence, and that the fire thereof being very different from the nature of other fires, doth effect ſtrange things. For it is not onely more pearcing by reaſon of the quicke motion thereof, but it is alſo much hotter then all other fire. Whereupon it commeth, that it can kill any kinde of creature by the onely touch thereof. And ſometimes the purſe remaining whole and ſound, it melteth the money that is therein: which is not fabulous as many thinke, nor yet on the other ſide very much to be admired. For that which hurteth, doth corrupt either by meanes of the quantitie, or for the long continuance thereof. And therefore the thunder-fire which is moſt ſubtile, breaketh not the purſe: for by reaſon that it hath very quicke motion, it ſtaieth not on it, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not it endommage it ſo. Moreouer, as the aire doth demonſtrate vnto vs, that by reaſon of the ſubtilitie thereof, it paſſeth thorough the purſe, without any reſting vpon it, and entreth thereinto, filling it when it is emptie, though it be faſt ſhut (which coulde not be, if it found not paſſage through inſenſible waies and holes, ſith the mouth of the purſe is very cloſe ſhut:) So likewiſe one little ſparke of thunder-fire, far more ſubtile then the aire, may eaſily enter into the purſe, where finding mettall, it faſteneth thereon, and ſtaieth therein, cauſing it to melt by the extreme violence and ſudden force thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:8737:110"/>So then the ſolid bodies, as iron, ſiluer, and gold are by ſo much the ſooner ſpoiled and molten by the lightning, by how much they doe more withſtand, and make reſiſtance againſt it. But in thoſe bodies which be rare, full of holes, ſoft and weake, the thunder paſſeth quicke ouer them, without hurting them, as is ſeene in the garments that men weare, and in very drie wood. For other wood burneth, by reaſon that the moiſture which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth therein doth reſiſt and kindle. Whereupon it followeth (if we beleeue <hi>Plutarch</hi>) that ſuch as ſleepe are neuer ſtroken with thunder: bicauſe that the ſleeping man is looſe, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſoft and vnequall, and in manner diſſolued, with his pores open, as if his ſpirit failed, and left him: ſo that the lightning findeth no ſuch reſiſtance in him, as it would doe if he were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake. Whereunto this may be alſo added; that he which ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, hauing no feare, aſtoniſhment, nor dread in him, is by this meanes oftentimes defended from thunder. For it is certaine, that many haue died with feare onely and apprehenſion which they haue taken thereof, without ſuffering any violence. Wherefore conſidering that the ſenſe of hearing is of all other ſenſes the moſt ſubiect to ſuffer violent paſſions; and that feares and dread which proceede of noiſe, doe bring the greateſt trouble to the ſoule: thereupon he which waketh and apprehendeth very much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth bound and thicke in his bodie: ſo that the lightning falling vpon him, giueth a greater blowe and a ruder ſtroke, in ſo much as it findeth greater reſiſtance.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Meruailous effects of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note>It is woonderfull to conſider the ſtrange caſes, that many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors report to haue happened through thunder. But amongſt all, that is very admirable, which <hi>Iulius obſequius</hi> reciteth of the daughter of <hi>Pompeius Lionis</hi> a knight of Rome. For ſhe returning from certaine plaies and turnayments celebrated at Rome, was ſuddenly ſtroken from hir palfrey with a thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derclap, ſtark-dead, without apparance of any wound, or fracture of member. But when hir father cauſed hir to be ſtript to burie and interre hir, they perceiued hir toong to come foorth at the bottome of hir wombe: whereby they knewe that the thunder and fire had ſtroken hir directly through the mouth, and ſo had iſſued out at the lower paſſage: a thing exceeding fearefull, and woorthie of great maruell. That which <hi>Du Bartas,</hi> the honour of the Poets of our age, hath written in his no leſſe learned then Chriſtian weeke, to haue beene ſeene of the effects of thunder by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8737:110"/>
a woman, though it may rather miniſter cauſe of laughter then of ſorrow, yet is it very maruellous. For he recounteth that the flame ſindged away all the haire about this womans ſecrets at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, without doing her any harme. But omitting theſe diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I will note certaine particularities, which ſome philoſophers affirme touching thunder. They ſay then,<note place="margin">Colomn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> and the keeles of ſhips exempt from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of thunder.</note> that it neuer or very ſeldome toucheth pillars, nor the keeles of ſhips, by reaſon of the depth of the one, and roundnes of the other. So that the blowe thereof running along the pillars doth very ſeldome ſtrike them: as alſo not being able to deſcend aboue fiue cubits vnder ground, and the bottoms of ſhips being very lowe, it ſcarcely euer falleth there. And therefore it is a ſure remedie againſt lightning to hide ones ſelfe in deepe caues. It is alſo to be noted, that although the brightnes of the lightning be ſeene before the noiſe of thunder be heard, yet proceede they not one before another, but are both togither. And the reaſon hereof is eaſie to vnderſtand.<note place="margin">Why the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thunder is perceiued before the ſound be heard.</note> For bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſight is quicker and ſharper then hearing, the eie doth ſooner behold the brightnes of the lightning, then the eare doth heare the ſound of the thunder; as we ſee plainly when a man cuts downe a tree, or beateth vpon any thing that reſoundeth, eſpecially if we be farre off. For we ſhall ſee him ſtrike the ſtroke ſooner then we can heare it: as likewiſe we prooue in ordinance, and in all guns and peeces, whoſe fire wee ſhall ſee, before wee heare the noiſe of their ſhoot, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that they are both performed togither. But wee haue dwelt long ynough on this matter, concerning that which philoſophers doe teach.

                  <p>THE Philoſophers call Meteors, by a Greeke name, that part of natural philoſophie, which entreateth of the aire, and of the things
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8737:111"/>
engendred therein, and appertayning thereto: as namely the cloudes, raine, ſnow, thunders, tempeſts, lightnings, and ſuch like, becauſe that they are ouer and aboue vs. For the ſignification of the Greeke word (Meteoron) importeth ſo much. But the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall profit that like Chriſtians, we muſt deſire &amp; purchaſe from this part of Philoſophie, is, that we learne by the contemplation and conſideration of the works of God, of which we now intreat, what is his power, wiſedome, bountie, and benignitie towards vs, and how it manifeſteth it ſelfe before our eies; not onely in the higheſt heauens, wherein the ſunne, moone, and ſtarres are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned (as we haue heretofore ſhewed) but alſo in the aire and in all the elements placed vnder the ſpheres. For by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we may reape verie great fruits.<note place="margin">Of the profit which the knowledge of the meteors bringeth to Chriſtians.</note> Firſt, in that we are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all theſe things are in the power of our father, who is the creator of them: &amp; that they are all created for our good like the reſt of his works, and not for our ruine and perdition.

                  <p>SIth that God is not ſubiect to the nature which hee hath created, but doth euer reſt the Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thereof, who can performe both without it, and with it all that he pleaſeth: it therefore followeth, that we muſt refer, not to the creatures or to nature, the workes, which he hath done in them, &amp; by them, but to him alone, &amp; muſt attribute to him the totall glorie thereof, &amp; to depend wholy vpon him, and vpon his prouidence. Now if we ſhall conſider all creatures in their originall and end ordained by God, we ſhall finde that they are all good, and ordained by the creator for the benefit of the good. And yet it might ſeeme that he hath eſtabliſhed ſome things, principally to take vengeance on the wicked, as by this text of ſcripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 32.</note> where the Lord ſaith to <hi>Iob;</hi> [Haſt thou entred into the treaſures of the ſnowe? or haſt thou ſeene the treaſures of the haile, which I haue hid againſt the time of trouble, againſt the day of warre and battell?] In which text is deliuered vnto vs a goodly doctrine of the forme, and of the place, where the ſnow and haile are engendred, to wit, in the chambers builded by God
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8737:113"/>
among the waters, which he gardeth as treaſures, and congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to ſerue him for ſcourges, to chaſtiſe and puniſh the froward.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.</note> For it is he (as the Pſalmiſt chaunteth) who giueth ſnowe like wooll, and ſcattereth the hoare froſt like aſhes. He caſteth foorth his ice like morſels: who can abide the cold thereof? He ſendeth his worde and melteth them: he cauſeth his winde to blowe, and the waters flowe. This is he alſo (as ſaith <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi>) which haſteneth the ſnowe by his commandement,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 43.</note> and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth the cloudes with great force to make the haileſtones cracke. The ſouth winde bloweth according to his wil: the ſtorme of the north, and the whirlewinde flying out like birds, ſcatter the ſnowe, and the falling downe thereof is as an heape of graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers or locuſts that light downe in any countrie. The eie hath the whitenes thereof in admiration, and the hart is aſtoniſhed at the fall of it. The Lord powreth out the froſt vpon the earth like ſalt, which when it is frozen ſticketh on the tops of pales. The cold north winde bloweth, and the water is frozen: it abideth vpon the gatherings togither of the water, and clotheth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as with a breſtplate. It deuoureth the mountaines, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the wildernes, and deſtroieth that that is greene, like fire. The preſent remedie againſt all this, is a cloude, and the deaw comming before the heate, appeaſeth it. It is alſo written in the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> [The whirlewinde commeth out of the heape of cloudes, and the cold from the northwinde,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 37.</note> at the breath of God the froſt is giuen, and the bredth of the waters is made narrow.] And therefore the Lord ſaith to <hi>Iob,</hi> [Out of whoſe wombe came the ice? who hath engendred the froſt of the heauen? The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are hid as with a ſtone: and the face of the deepe is couered.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 38.</note>] Which is as much to ſay, as the waters take to them the forme of a ſtone, when they are conuerted into haile and ice, and that the ſea is frozen ouer: for when the water is frozen, it ſeemeth to be hid and loſt, and to be no more water.</p>
                  <p>Surely in theſe diſcourſes we haue much to conſider concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the woonders of God. For is it not an admirable thing, that the water, which is ſo ſoft, and runs ſo ſwiftly, ſhould become as hard as ſtones, and that it can fall from heauen in ſuch forme, yea ſometimes ſo great that it doth not onely ſpoile the fruits of the earth, but doth alſo breake the branches of trees, and kil men and beaſts. Hereof that is a certaine teſtimonie which we read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the haile, which God ſent vpon the Egyptians,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.</note> by the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8737:114"/>
miniſterie of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10.</note> and vpon the Amorites in the time of <hi>Ioſhuah,</hi> in the warre of the Gibeonites. Indeede this was done contrarie to the common courſe of nature, in reſpect of the Egyptians eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially. For their land is not moiſtned, nor watred with raine from heauen, but onely by the riuer Nilus. And therefore the power of God was euidently ſhewed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.</note> when he cauſed ſo great haile to fall downe vpon the enimies of his people, that no man could iudge it to be naturall. For haile is made of raine frozen in the aire: and is different from ſnow and miſts, in that the haile is engendred of raine more hard frozen: ſnowe of moiſture more ſoftly thickned: and miſts and fogs of cold deawes. So that when the congealed water is frozen by a ſtrong colde, it becommeth haile: if by a ſmall cold, it engendreth ſmall driſling haile, ſuch as falles commonly in the ſpring time, as in March and Aprill. But this me thinketh is worthie of greateſt wonder, that the water in ſommer time ſhould be congealed into haile, and that during the great heate of the ſunne, the greateſt congelation ſhould be made, from whence commeth this word amongſt the Latines <hi>(Grando)</hi> which is as much to ſay, as a great drop of water: which is not ſeene in winter, when euery thing, through the exceeding colde, freezeth here on earth: or if ſo be this happen in ſuch a time, it is ſpoken of as a new and ſtrange thing that comes not ordinarily in this ſeaſon, like the ſnowe and miſts, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to winter and cold weather. For though the Naturaliſts tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell much to ſhew that all things are produced by inferior and naturall cauſes; yet muſt we principally acknowledge a diuine puiſſance aboue all, who hath cauſes hidden in his incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible treaſures from men, by which the haile, thunder, lightning, tempeſtes and ſtormes are diſpoſed and diſperſed according to his good pleaſure.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.</note> For as God made knowne to his people, by the Manna which he ſent them in the wildernes, wherewith he nouriſhed them for the ſpace of fortie yeeres in a barren and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable place, that he could euermore very eaſily finde meanes ynough, both ordinarie and extraordinarie, to nouriſh and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them: ſo hath he made manifeſt by the rods and ſcourges wherewith he hath beaten the Egyptians, that he can euermore very eaſily inuent meanes ynow to puniſh his enimies, ſo often and whenſoeuer he pleaſeth, yea euen then, when there ſhall be no appeerance thereof amongſt men.</p>
                  <p>Now as God, when he pleaſeth, conuerteth the water into
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8737:114"/>
ſtones,<note place="margin">Of the frozen water and how it is thawed.</note> and ſo hardneth it that by great cold he doth (as it were) paue, not onely riuers, ponds, and lakes, but alſo great ſeas; which he maketh ſo firme, that one may paſſe ouer them, yea and draw ouer great and heauy chariots, as it were ouer bridges, and firme land: ſo when it pleaſeth him, he cauſeth all this water ſo harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to returne into the proper kinde thereof, as if it had neuer beene frozen. And as there be windes to congeale it, ſo there are windes to diſſolue and thaw it. For wee muſt note, that yee doth not diſſolue and thaw by the heate of the ſunne onely, but alſo by the power of the windes ordained hereto, yea and much ſooner ſo, then otherwiſe. Concerning all which things, and the cauſes of them, which God hath created and eſtabliſhed in nature, wee ſhall heere make a briefe and generall diſcourſe. For if we ſhould ſpeake as the Philoſophers haue written and diſputed, we ſhould haue matter enough to compoſe a great volume. But we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues ſimply to propound heere the admirable works of God, by which euery one may learne to feare, and honor him: which is the onely,<note place="margin">Of the true profit that muſt be reaped con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</note> and the greateſt profit that wee muſt make of meteors, whereof our ſpeech hath hitherto beene, and which do yet reſt for vs to conſider of. For our intent is to manifeſt in them, not onely the workes of the creation, which are therein propoſed, but thoſe alſo of the diuine prouidence, which are in the ſame after diuers ſorts declared: and not to do as many, who are eſteemed very learned in naturall Philoſophie, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther letters and humane ſciences; who are ſo badly aduanced in the knowledge of God by them, that in ſtead of acknowledging and gloryfying him as it behooueth them, they rather become Atheiſts and Epicures, contemners and mockers of his Maieſtie, and of all religion. But the iudgements of God ſhall therefore light very greeuous vpon them, becauſe they ſhall be by ſo much the more inexcuſable. For they are of the number of thoſe of whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that by their infidelity, &amp; iniuſtice,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> they detaine the truth in iniuſtice, becauſe they vniuſtly and wilfully ſuppreſſe the knowledge of the Eternall: for hauing knowne him in the works of the creation of the world,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> which are as a mirrour and ſhew of inuiſible things, they glorifie him not as God, neither are thankfull: but become vaine in their imaginations, and their fooliſh hart is full of darknes, and when they profeſſe themſelues wiſe, they become fooles; bicauſe it hath pleaſed God ſo to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their proud preſumption, and the vanitie of their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8737:115"/>
Wherefore likewiſe as the Apoſtle ſaith in another place:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> They haue their cogitations darkened, and are ſtrangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hardnes of their harts. For by reaſon that they abuſe the gift of knowledge, which they haue in a more ample meaſure then others, therefore doth the Omnipotent by his iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make them more blinde then the ſimple and ignorant; ſo that they are rather woorthie to be accounted as beaſts then as men. And yet the ſcience and knowledge which they haue of the works of God more abundant then others, is not cauſe of their blindnes, conſidering that it is an excellent gift from aboue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for all thoſe, which can and will well vſe it: but their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ingratitude, and peruerſenes of hart and vnderſtanding pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this euill vpon them, through their owne fault, and by the iuſt vengeance of God. So that whereas their skill ſhould open their eies to guide them by the knowledge of the creatures, to that of the creator, it is rather an hinderance vnto them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth them of that great and ſoueraigne good.

                  <p>ALthough we haue hitherto ſpoken of ſundrie ſorts of the creatures and workes of God, by which he manifeſteth and declareth his power, glorie, maieſtie, and eternall prouidence, and chiefly in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the aire, neuertheles there doe yet a great number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, which we haue nothing at all touched either particularly or in generall, no not ſo much as curſorily. For there are ſo many ſorts of fires of diuers formes that appeere in the skie aboue, that it is impoſſible to diſtinguiſh them all particularly. And amongſt them there are ſome which ſomtimes ſeeme to fall from heauen,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8737:115"/>
or as if the ſtars did ſnuffe themſelues, as men ſnuffe a candle: ſo that the moſt part of the rude and ignorant people ſuppoſe it is ſo. Many others thinke that ſometimes the ſtarres ſparkle.<note place="margin">Why it ſeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> do ſparkle.</note> But the cauſe of ſuch appeerance is, for that the ſubſtance of heauen being verie cleere, their beames ſhining towards vs, are euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more broken perpendicularly. For the aire being mooued, euen as we ſee the ſtones in the bottome of a riuer ſeeme to tremble, becauſe of the running motion of the water; ſo do the ſtars ſeeme to ſparkle: and when the middle of the aire is vehemently ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aboue, then they ſeeme to ſparkle both more and oftner. But we will leaue this talke to ſpeake of certaine heauenly fires, which we call comets, and which are worthie of great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of much maruell.<note place="margin">Of comets and of the place where they are engendred.</note> For they appeere like bearded and hairie ſtars, hauing their motion with the heauen as if they were verie ſtars: and certes we might well ſuppoſe them ſuch, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in heauen like the reſt, if they ſhould long time continue. But the opinion of many is, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> likewiſe writeth in his Meteors) that they are naturally made of an hot exhalation, which attayneth to the ſupreme region of the aire, where it is enflamed by the element of fire: ſo that of ſuch an exhalation are fires kindled in heauen of diuers ſorts and faſhions. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſome learned moderne writers which haue diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the height, whither theſe vapours may mount, do thinke cleane otherwiſe: for they affirme that comets cannot be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the region of the elements: and are not afraid to giue ſentence againſt <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who in truth being an Ethnike and Pagan, hath failed in the reſolution of many particular queſtions. For he hath ſtrained himſelfe to affirme manie generall propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which our experience ſheweth to be vtterly falſe: as theſe.<note place="margin">Some propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle falſe.</note> [That no liuing thing apprehendeth by ſenſe that which is good; that a thing poized can incline neither to the one ſide nor to the other; and that the earth is in no part higher then the waters; and ſundrie others.] Now if it hath beene permitted him to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the opinion of his maſter <hi>Plato</hi> who taught the truth, yea and to reprehend him: it ſhall be alſo lawfull for vs, and verie laudable to ſeparate our ſelues in opinion from him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his writings for the truth.</p>
                  <p>They then that do not acknowledge comets to bee conioyned vnto, and depending vpon the effects of the elementarie fire, and aire, by meanes of exhalations and vapors ariſing from the earth,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8737:116"/>
do alledge among other reaſons, that the place which is ſeene by the inhabitants of Milan vnder the circle of winter or the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of Capricorne, is diſtant from the earth ten times more then the height that the vapors attaine to.<note place="margin">Reaſons of thoſe who ſay that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> are ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in heauen.</note> And therefore the comets beeing ſeene there higher then the place of the vapors, it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followeth, that they are not there ingendred, neither yet in the higheſt of the pure aire called (Aether) conſidering that there is no matter, which may be kindled. But if any one alledge that the combuſtible humor is rauiſhed and attracted thither by the power of the ſtars, though that this place be higher then the common place of vapors; wee may anſwere, that forſomuch as wee behold many comets to continue more then two months, and ſome three, that this their long continuance may bee an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment thereto: becauſe that the totall maſſe of the earth would not be ſufficient for ſuch an inflammation. For fire is not perpetually fedde with one onely matter, but requireth a new ſupply. And ſeeing that theſe comets haue for the moſt part a beard or a taile, and are ſeated in an higher place then the aire; a man cannot iudge them to bee leſſe then the Moone. And it ſeemeth impoſſible that ſo much matter ſhould be conſumed as might maintaine this huge flame for three moneths. Moreouer, there is a meanes to know, whether the comet be in the region of the aire, or elſe be inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred in heauen. For if it be quicker in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from weſt to eaſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moone is; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of neceſſity muſt the place of the comet be vnder the loweſt ſphere: but if it be more ſlow,<note place="margin">Comets moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with three motions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> then without doubt it is bred in heauen. Now it is common to all comets to be mooued with three motions: namely, with the firſt from eaſt to weſt in the ſpace of fower &amp; twentie houres, like all the ſtars: with the ſecond from weſt to eaſt, almoſt in like ſpace of time with the planet Venus. For a comet which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered the two and twentieth day of September 1532. and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the third day of December, proceeded (as <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) in 71. daies from the fift part of Virgo, to the eight part of Scorpio. Which maketh manifeſt that it could not be vnder the Moone: for then it ſhould haue beene more ſwiftly mooued then this planet: which retrogradeth thirteenth parts of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacke in fower and twentie howers, according to the ordinarie courſe of the firſt motion: and the comet had proceeded but 63. degrees in 71. daies. But for the third motion peculiar to all comets, which is conſidered according to the latitude, it is ſuch
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8737:116"/>
and ſo great, that if the foreſaid Author be not deceiued, one is now mooued with incredible ſpeed towards the North, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an inſtant towards the South. Which commeth to paſſe when the comets are neere to any of the Poles, for then a little varietie of place conferred to the Zodiacke doth greatly change the latitude. Beſides, it is to be noted, that the beard of euerie comet doth directly ſtretch out that way, which is oppoſite to the Sunne: and when it ſetteth, the ſame taile is ſtraight Eaſtward: As the like may be daily ſeene in the darke part of the Moone. Moreouer, the comet doth moſt vſually accompanie the Sunne, and appeereth not but at euen-tide, &amp; at the ſhutting vp of the day. Which giueth vs to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<note place="margin">What a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met properly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> that a comet is a globe placed in heauen, which being inlightned by the Sunne doth plainely appeere: and when his rayes paſſe farther, they ſhew like the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a bread, or of a tayle. Whereupon it appeereth, that this flaming globe may be made in the midſt of the ſpheres, if the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration thereof be in them: or elſe we muſt ſay (and that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth true) that the heauen is full of many ſtars, not verie maſſie, which (the aire being drie and attenuated) do preſent themſelues to our ſight. For Venus hirſelfe is ſometimes ſeene in broad day, which none can ſay to be newly engendred.<note place="margin">Of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies which are attributed to comets.</note> Then through this drines of the aire it commonly happeneth, that the ſeas are much turmoiled with tempeſts, and that great bluſtring windes doe follow thereupon, and that Monarches &amp; great Princes, who are moſt drie through cold &amp; watchings, or elſe through abundance of hot and delicate meates and of ſtrong wine, do thereupon die: So likewiſe the drie and attenuated aire cauſeth the waters to diminiſh, fiſhes to die, and ſcarcitie of victuals, which oftentimes ſtirreth vp ſeditions, and the chaunge of lawes, and finally the ſubuerſion of ſtates. All which things (I ſay) doe ſeeme in ſome ſort to proceed through the great tenuitie and drines of the aire: &amp; thereof the comet then appeering may be a ſigne &amp; token, but not the cauſe. But if we wil meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things like chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, we will ſay, that what naturall cauſes ſoeuer Naturaliſts and Aſtrologers can render concerning comets, ſignes and woonders which appeere ſometimes in heauen, that they ſhould be ſo often vnto vs, like ſo many trumpets, heraulds, and fore-runners of the Iuſtice of God, to aduertiſe men that they remaine not buried in their filth and ſinnes, but returne to the infinite goodnes of God, who reacheth out his hand, and calleth to vs through ſuch ſignes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8737:117"/>
to change our life and leaue our execrable vices, to the ende that through his mercie, we may obtaine pardon for our faults.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of diuers kinds of comets.</note>But let vs likewiſe note, that although ſundry ſorts of comets are ſeene, yet the Greekes call them properly ſtars that haue a ſanguine buſh of haire, and are briſtled at the top. And thoſe, which haue vnder them a long beard made like haires, they call (Pogonies.) <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth of ſundrie other ſorts: and ſaith, that the ſhorteſt time that euer comet was ſeene to appeare, hath beene ſeuen daies,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 2.</note> and the longeſt time eightie. He maketh mention alſo of one, which ſeemed terrible about the clime of Egypt and Ethiopia. For it was flaming and wreathed round like a ſerpent, hauing a very hideous and dreadfull aſpect: ſo that one would haue ſaid, that it had rather beene a knot of fire, then a ſtarre. Afterward this author concludeth his ſpeech, with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that many haue (as is aboueſaid) that comets are perpetuall, and that they haue a proper and peculiar motion: ſaying alſo, that none can ſee them, except they be very far diſtant from the ſunne, in ſuch ſort that they may not be couered with his beames. And yet the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is cleane contrarie thereto, and ſo are a great number of other philoſophers, who affirme that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets are compoſed of a certaine fire, and of an humor which it lighteth on by chance, for which cauſe, they are ſubiect to reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But we will proceede no farther in this argument, nor yet concerning the ſituation of them, whether they be vnder the ſpheres, or amongſt them: but will purſue our purpoſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things vndoubtedly engendred in the higheſt elements, as namely the cloudes.

                  <p>AS the Lord and father of this great vniuers doth publiſh his glorie by the motions of the heauens, &amp; the maruellous courſes of all the lights in them; ſo doth he likewiſe in the aire after many ſorts, as we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die heard, &amp; as we haue yet good proofs in that which is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs for the matter of our diſcourſe. And therefore the kingly prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.</note> that the heauens report the glory of God,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:8737:117"/>
and the firmament doth declare his works. For the Hebrew word, which wee call firmament, doth properly ſignifie (a ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad) and comprehendeth both the heauen and the aire. Now let vs firſt note, that there is nothing more weake then the aire, nor any element that can worſe ſuſtaine a charge, if it haue no other prop. Then let vs conſider of what matter the cloudes are made, and what firmenes they may retaine.<note place="margin">How cloudes are made of vapors.</note> It is certaine that they are nothing elſe but vapors attracted out of the waters by the power of the ſunne, as wee behold after a great raine, when the heat of the ſunne ſtriketh vpon the earth. For wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the water to aſcend vpwards like a great ſmoke: and wee ſee an other cleere experience hereof in wet clothes and linnen, when they receiue the heat of heauen, or of the fire. So it is then, that the water ceaſeth not to mount from earth vp into the aire, and then to deſcend downe againe; ſo that the courſe thereof is perpetuall, as if there were a ſea mounting from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which we call (Aire,) then deſcending from thence downe hither to vs. For after that of vapors, which aſcend from the earth, the cloudes are gathered togither, which like ſpunges doe receiue the ſteame of the waters, whereof they themſelues are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred; then doe they carrie them like chariots, to diſtribute them through all the quarters of the world, according as is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the prouidence of God. And therefore <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith in the booke of <hi>Iob.</hi> [Behold God is excellent, and we know it not,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 36.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the number of his yeeres be ſearched out, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth the drops of water, the raine powreth downe by the vapor thereof, which raine the clouds doe drop and let fall abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly vpon man.] Then proceeding to ſhew, how God ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out the light of the ſunne vpon the waters of the ſea, to draw out and produce vapors, he addeth: [Who can know the diuiſions (that is the varieties and diuerſities) of the cloudes, and the thunders of his tabernacle? Behold hee ſpreadeth his light vpon it, and couereth the rootes of the ſea.] Meaning by rootes the waters of the ſea, as well becauſe they are deepe, as for that they are diuided by diuers waues like the branches of rootes.<note place="margin">Propertie of the windes in regard of the cloudes.</note> Moreouer, we muſt conſider that to carrie &amp; conuey the cloudes hither and thither, God hath created the winds, which blow from all the quarters of the world: ſome to gather the cloudes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to bring raine and ſnow, or haile and tempeſts, by meanes of the ſame cloudes, according as pleaſeth the Creator
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:8737:118"/>
to diſpoſe them: other winds on the contrarie do diſperſe them and make the aire cleere and pleaſant, bringing faire weather. Hereof then it commeth, that aboue in the aire, betweene hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, there is, as it were an other heauen made of clouds ſpread out like a curtaine, and like a vault or couering ouer our heads, which hindreth vs of ſight of the Sunne, Moone and ſtars. But as this maſſe of cloudes is made by meanes of winds ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereto, ſo when it pleaſeth God to giue vs faire weather, then doth he ſende vs other winds, which chaſe away all theſe cloudes, and cleere the aire, as if they had beene ſwept away, and the heauen ſheweth another countenance to the world, as if it had beene changed and renued.</p>
                  <p>Now while the aire is ſo filled with cloudes, this may verie well be conſidered by vs, that men haue then (as it were) a great ſea of water ouer their heads, contayned and held within thoſe cloudes, as the waters of the ſea are within the bounds which are aſſigned them for their courſe. Which it ſeemeth that <hi>Moſes</hi> taught, when he ſheweth that God creating all things ſeparated the waters, which are vpon the earth, from thoſe which are in the aire,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1.</note> ſaying thus: [That there was a ſtretching out betweene the waters, and that it ſeparated the waters from the waters. God then made the firmament (or ſpreading abroad or ſtretching out) and ſeparated the waters, which are vnder the firmament from thoſe which were aboue it, and it was ſo. And God called the firmament, Heauen.] It is ſure that by theſe words, many haue thought that the prophet would teach, that there were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, both vnder &amp; aboue heauen: which ſeemeth to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. Whether there be any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all waters aboue the heauens.</note> ſaying [Praiſe yee the Lord heauens of heauens, &amp; waters that be aboue the heauens, praiſe his name.] Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is not verie eaſie for vs to vnderſtand what waters may be aboue the heauens, if we doe not take the name of heauen in theſe two texts, for the aire, as wee haue heretofore ſhewed, that it is oftentimes ſo taken. For what ſhall wee anſwere beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to what vſe the materiall waters may ſerue, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſpheres, or aboue the planets and ſtars? And for to take the name of waters here, for ſpirituall waters, not corporall, as many haue argued: mee ſeemeth, (vnder correction of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer) which wee preferre in all our diſcourſes, that this cannot fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be affirmed, becauſe it doth euidently appeare, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of materiall waters. For he accommodating himſelfe to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8737:118"/>
a groſſe people, amongſt whom hee conuerſed, maketh no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the creation of the world, but of the creating of viſible and corporall things; ſo that there is ſmall likelihood that he ſhould ſpeake of other waters, mixing ſpirituall things with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. But becauſe the Latin tranſlator of the common verſion of the bible hath vſed, in this text, the word firmament, following the tranſlation of the Greekes, and not the proper word (ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad) as the Hebrue phraſe doth ſignifie; ſome of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned haue obſerued, how that many Latine diuines haue beene hindred from the vnderſtanding of this doctrine. For they haue taken the name Firmament, for the ſtarrie heauen (as alſo the Greekes haue iudged) imitating their tranſlation. Whereupon the imagination is ſproong of waters aboue the heauens, and of a chriſtalline heauen: which I ſuppoſe to haue been ſo called,<note place="margin">Of the chryſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line heauen.</note> by reaſon of theſe waters, which were ſuppoſed to be aboue the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament: bicauſe that chryſtall is made of ice, and ice of water. For it had beene very difficult to conceiue how materiall waters, which by nature are corruptible, might be aboue the celeſtiall ſpheres, except they were hardened and conuerted into chryſtal, bicauſe that from the moone vpwards, there are no creatures ſubiect to corruption and to ſuch changes, as thoſe that are vnder the moone. Behold then, why theſe men haue ſuppoſed ſuch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to haue beene made partakers of the nature of heauen. But what neede is there to trauell in ſuch diſputations, and to take paines for to haue recourſe to allegories, when one may be eaſily ſatisfied with the literall ſenſe? For there is nothing more eaſie, then to make the wordes of <hi>Moſes</hi> cleere and euident, being throughly conſidered. For firſt he hath declared,<note place="margin">Of the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall waters.</note> how that the earth was couered all ouer with water, and that there was a great deepe ouerwhelmed with darknes, ſo that the earth did in no wiſe appeere, till ſuch time as God had commanded the waters to retire themſelues into their places, which he hath aſſigned for their perpetuall reſidence. And then the earth was diſcouered, euen ſo much thereof as was needfull for the habitation and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of men, and of all the creatures, which God did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes create.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.</note> Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> (as the expounder of <hi>Moſes</hi> words, ſaith) That the Lord hath ſet the earth vpon hir founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: adding ſtraight after, That hee had couered it with the deepe, as with a garment, and that the waters did ſtand aboue the mountaines; but at his rebuke they fled: which is as much to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:8737:119"/>
ſay, as when God had commanded the waters to retire and to diſcouer the earth, they ſuddenly obeied the voice of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> hauing ſpoken of thoſe waters which are reſident here belowe on earth, gathered as well into the ſea, as into foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and riuers, he afterwards declareth, how God would aſſigne vnto them another abode in a certaine region of the aire, which he firſt calleth a ſpreading abroad, and after that heauen, which the Pſalmiſt alſo ſignifieth when he ſaith of God, that he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe with light as with a garment, and ſpreadeth the heauens like a curtaine, which is to ſay, that the light is to the creator like a ſtately garment, wherein we beholde his glorie to ſhine and gliſter euery where, and that he hath ſpread abroad the heauens like a pauilion for his habitation. Moreouer he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, [The Lord doth lay the iouſts of his high chambers amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the waters: he maketh the great cloudes his chariot: He holdeth backe (ſaith <hi>Iob</hi>) the face of his throne and ſtretcheth out his cloude vpon it.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 26.</note>] And therefore the Scripture doth alſo teach vs, that God hath ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times declared his preſence,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.14.16 <hi>&amp;.</hi> 40. <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.</note> &amp; manifeſted his glory both to <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; to all the people of Iſraell by the cloudes. And when Ieſus Chriſt aſcended into heauen, a cloud taking him, bare him vp in the ſight of his apoſtles: to declare vnto them, and make them ſure of the place whither he went: vſing this cloude as a triumphant chariot, which hath giuen teſtimonie of his ſoueraigne and eternall maieſtie. And therefore it is alſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that he ſhall come in the cloudes of heauen with power and glorie. Wherefore if we were well inſtructed in the ſacred word of God, we ſhould haue a verie cleere doctrine concerning Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, and which were much more profitable then that which Philoſophers teach.

                  <p>I Will begin my ſpeech with the ſaying of the kingly prophet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.</note> who after that he had appointed the heauens for the pauilion of God, &amp; ordained the cloudes for the planchers thereof, whereupon are raiſed the loftie chambers (that is to ſay, the great &amp; ſpatious waters amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp within the cloudes, which he alſo propoſeth vnto vs as the chariot, vpon which the Eternall is borne) being conſequently willing to ſhew what the horſes are, by which this chariot is dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen and driuen, he ſaith [He walketh vpon the wings of the wind. He maketh the ſpirits his meſſengers, and flaming fire his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:] which is as much, as if in ſum he would declare, that men need not labour to mount aloft into heauen there to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>template and behold God, ſith that hee ſo cleerely manifeſteth himſelfe throughout the whole world, principally by the celeſtiall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and then by the magnificent and maruellous works, which he daily performeth heere in the aire neere vnto vs, and before our eies. So ſurely, if we muſt account as great miracles, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Sunne vnto vs and his returne, which daily continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the courſes and motions of all the other celeſtiall bodies; we haue no leſſe occaſion to account as a thing miraculous and worthie of great wonder, that we ſo often behold here below,<note place="margin">Wonder of the waters carried in the aire.</note> a great cel of waters ouer our heads in the aire, ſuſtained by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe, &amp; by vapours like to ſmoke, as if they were hanged in the aire, and were there borne vp without any ſtay and prop, but by the inuiſible vertue and power of God. For otherwiſe, how could the cloudes ſuſtaine ſo great heapes, and ſuch deepe gulfes of water, conſidering that they are nothing elſe but water, and do alſo come at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to reſolue into water? Againe how without this diuine power could theſe cloudes be ſupported in the aire, ſeeing that the aire it ſelfe ſeemeth to conſiſt of waters moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly diſtilled, beeing very light, and in continuall motion. For it euidently appeareth, that the aire retaineth much of the nature of water, becauſe that ſo ordinarily it conuerteth thereinto, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incloſed in a cold and moiſt place: ſo that many fountaines
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:8737:120"/>
are by this meanes engendred of aire, if wee will credite Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts. And therefore as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith of the waters, which runne about the earth, that God hath appointed a bound vnto them, which they may not paſſe, nor returne any more to ouerflow the habitation of men: ſo may wee likewiſe ſay, that he hath boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the waters that hang in the aire, within the cloudes, to the end that they may not run looſely aſtray.<note place="margin">

He was ſet vpon the floud, and he ſhal remaine king for euer:] which is aſmuch to ſay, as the Lord hath executed his iudgement vpon the wicked, by the waters of the floud, and that as then he tooke vengeance, ſo it is he, that doth for euer remaine iudge of the world, and that maketh all creatures to tremble before him. Where wee haue great matter of feare and trembling, if wee beleeue the word of God, and the teſtimonies which it deliuereth of his iudgements, when I ſay, we diligently conſider the effects of the nature of the higher ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore whenſoeuer wee ſee cloſe weather, and the aire filled with cloudes, threatning vs with raine and tempeſts, the ſight thereof ſhould alwaies refreſh and renew in vs the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this iudgement of God, ſo terrible and vniuerſall in the flud, to teach vs to walke in more feare of his Maieſtie.

                  <p>I knowe very well, that the ſcripture ſaith that God ſet the raine-bow in the cloudes for ſigne of an accord and attonement betweene him and men, and euery liuing creature, to the ende that the waters might neuer after increaſe to ſuch a floud as ſhould roote out all fleſh.

But it was not vſed by God for a teſtimonie of his attonement with mankinde, till after the flood. So likewiſe it is certaine, that this heauenly bowe hath naturally had at all times the ſignifications which at this preſent it retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, to preſage raine or faire weather, according as it diuerſly appeereth. But ſince that the creator hath accepted it for a ſigne of his couenant, it hath had this vantage, to be ordained as a gage and witnes of the promiſes of God. And therefore whenſoeuer we behold it in heauen, we muſt not onely conſider of it, as of a naturall thing, and as a prognoſticator ſometimes of raine, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of faire weather: but likewiſe as a witnes and memoriall as well of the iudgement of God, as of his grace and mercie, and of the aſſurance of the conſeruation of all creatures by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

For euery darke obſcure thing is, as it were, almoſt blacke, as the ſhadowes doe demonſtrate, which by reaſon of their obſcuritie ſeeme to be blacke. And when an obſcure thing is illuminated, if it be bright, it paſſeth in colours, according to the abundance of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

For the heate of the ſun doth conuert it firſt into vapors, which are drawne out of the leaſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall and moſt ſubtile parts thereof, which approch neereſt to the nature of the aire. For which cauſe theſe vapors are more eaſily conuerted into aire, the which reſolueth it ſelfe againe into water, then when ſuch vapors are arriued at the middle region of the aire, which is the coldeſt part thereof, as well by reaſon that it is farther diſtant from the ſunne and from all the other celeſtiall and aetherian fires, then the ſupreme part thereof is; as likewiſe becauſe it cannot be heated like the loweſt part thereof, by reuerberation of the ſunnes heate, which ſcorcheth the earth. Wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> declaring vnto vs, how the Lord made the water mount from the earth, and conuerted it into vapors, ſaith:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8737:122"/>
[The Lord God had not cauſed it to raine vpon the earth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 2.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there a man to til the ground, but a miſt (or vapor) went vp from the earth, and watered all the earth.] For we behold eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, how that after the aire hath beene refreſhed by the coole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the night, the dew falleth in the morning vpon the earth: and if the colde hath beene great, it is turned into miſte, &amp; white hoarie-froſt, from which proceed the froſts that doe oftentimes ſpoile vines and trees, which are moſt tender in colde weather, when their branches are yet feeble, and they begin to budde.</p>
                  <p>And let vs note, that there are two ſorts of vapors,<note place="margin">Of two ſorts of vapors, which make dew and raine.</note> which do commonly riſe from the terreſtriall towards the celeſtiall regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the one is fat and thicke, whereof the dewe is made; and the other is ſubtile and thinne, which turneth into raine. Cornefields are fatned by the dewe, which by reaſon of the thicknes thereof mounteth not very high: and if that any part of it be better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted (as doth happen ordinarily in hot countries) it reſteth condenſate through colde vpon the plants, and is called Manna. Of this it is that <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaketh, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 11.</note> that the great ſtarres being riſen in ſommer, and ſpecially the moſt excellent, or elſe when the raine-bowe is ouer the earth, and that it raine not, but onely make a ſmall dewe, which is heated by the ſunne-beames; that which then falleth is not home, but is an heauenly gift and ſingular medicine for the eies, for vlcers, and for thoſe accidents which may happen in the nauell and interior parts. Which Manna is plentifully gathered in Targa, a wildernes of Libya, neere to the citie Agades, eſpecially when the nights are very faire, partly for that they are colder then the day; and partly for that the dewes cannot conuert themſelues into the ſubſtance of clouds: becauſe as I ſaid it is condenſate by the cold. Whereupon enſueth that when the raine is ingendred of vapors, the colde cannot be great: for then ſuch vapors are attracted by the heate, and are preſently after thickned by the colde in the region of the aire. And therefore there is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Manna founde when the night is cloudie, and leſſe when it is rainie, for then it melteth. Behold then how the fatteſt part of vapors turneth into dew, &amp; that which mounteth vp, is condenſate through colde in the ſubtile aire,<note place="margin">Why it raineth but little in ſummer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly in other ſeaſons.</note> and is afterwardes conuerted into raine. And bicauſe that in ſommer the heate doth drie vp very neere ſo much as it attracteth in vapors, there is therefore verie ſeldome little raine therein: for conſidering
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8737:123"/>
that in our countries the heate is weake, it attracteth by little and little the vapors, which the drineſſe doth oftentimes conſume before they can be conuerted into raine. Wherefore it commeth to paſſe, that if it raine in ſommer, the raine is ſuddenly engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: for when the cloudes are too ſlowe, they are conſumed by the drineſſe of the ſunne. And there where the aire is very cold, and conſequently thicke and groſſe, the vapor, which is thither drawne, being very light, cannot be condenſate, bicauſe of the thicknes of the aire and the thinneſſe of the vapor. Which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that in ſtead of raine, ſnow is engendred: for ſnowe is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation of a vapor not condenſate for the ſubtilitie of his proper ſubſtance, and for bicauſe of the thicknes of the aire. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the cold is great in winter, it raineth little. And for the ſpring time, bicauſe that the ſucceeding day doth conſume more vapor, then the precedent day had attracted (for in the ſpring time the latter daies are ſtill hotter, and haue ſhorter nights) for this cauſe it raineth then leſſe then in autumne, and oftner then in ſommer or winter. But in Autumne ſhowres of raine are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly great, and of long continuance: For the ſunne being as then ſtill powerfull vpon the earth, many vapors are drawen vp. But bicauſe the ſucceeding day hath ſtill a longer night then the precedent, and for that it was alſo warmer, it is neceſſarie that the vapor ſhould thicken, and afterwardes deſcend. And when the earth is moiſtned, then that which did deſcend, is againe attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, lying then vpon the ſuperficies of the earth, and being ſtill ſomewhat deeper then before. Whereof are made not onely raines, but alſo rainie and windie cloudes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Difference of raine water, and earth water.</note>Thus haue we in ſumme then the forme of dewes and raine, and the diuerſitie of their courſe, and how the earthly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly waters differ from one another, the raine water retaining more of the aire, and being much purer and lighter, then that which doth alwaies remaine in the earth. For in compariſon of terreſtriall water, it is like water diſtilled through a limbeck. And yet how light ſoeuer it be, it muſt neuertheles be heauier then the aire, and eſpecially when it is frozen within the cloudes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into ſnow or haile, which is like ſtones of ice. Wherein it ſeemeth that this rule of nature and naturall philoſophie is not generally true, which affirmeth, That euery heauie thing doth alwaies drawe downwards, conſidering there are waters hanged in the aire, which is much lighter then the waters that it ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8737:123"/>
Wherefore we muſt ſay,<note place="margin">Cloudes are in the aire, as ſhips are vpon the waters.</note> that cloudes are in the aire in the region that is aſſigned vnto them, in ſuch ſort as ſhips are in the water. For none doubteth, but that ſtones, iron, lead, and all other mettals, yea infinite other things of leſſe waight, are heauier then the water; yet we neuertheles doe behold, that there is no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſo waightie, but the water doth eaſily ſupport it, by meanes of a boat, or a wooden ſhip, or a galley, which ſhall be euen of it ſelfe a great and heauie loade. And yet the water, which will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine ſuch a charge, cannot beare vp a pinne, or a naile, or a ſmall peece of gold, or ſiluer, or a little ſtone, but all ſhall ſinke to the bottome. Now the cauſe of all theſe effects is in the participation that the wood hath with the aire, which maketh it much lighter then the other bodies, which are more ſolide and maſſie. For by reaſon that the wood is more open, and more looſe to giue way to the aire, it receiueth lightnes thereof, which cauſeth it to floate vpon the water, whereas the other more terreſtriall bodies doe ſinke thereinto. So then the aire ſuſtaineth by meanes of the cloudes, the waters, which they containe incloſed within them: euen as the ſea and great riuers ſuſtaine groſſe and heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens by meanes of ſhips. For though the cloudes doe conſiſt of water themſelues, and are engendred of it, being drawne into the aire, through blowing of the windes, and afterwards maſſed vp in one bodie (as we haue already vnderſtood) yet doe they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of a water leſſe terreſtriall, and more airie, then thoſe waters, which flowe here belowe: for which cauſe they are alſo more light, and more eaſily ſuſtained by the aire, vpon which they floate, like ſhips vpon the ſea and other waters. And afterwardes when the cloudes returne into their firſt nature of water, and when they be opened to let fall the waters which they containe, the water which proceedeth from them doth reſume alſo his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per courſe, according to the naturall heauines thereof, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth downwards, deſcending to the earth. And as ſhips ſinke downe into the water, when they are ouercharged, as likewiſe the charges and burdens, wherewith they are laden, when they are ſplit or broken by violence of windes, or by ſome other force which maketh them daſh one againſt another, and againſt the rocks: ſo is it with the cloudes, and with the things which they beare, and with the windes alſo wherewith they are driuen, or elſe are incloſed within them, which make a great noiſe, when they ſtriue to iſſue out, ſo that the cloudes are rent and cracke, as

the thunders teſtifie vnto vs, and the tempeſts, lightnings, and thunder claps which proceede from them, as alſo the great delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of water, which ſhowre downe with great violence and furie.

                        <hi>Iſay.</hi> 5.</note> [I will commaund the cloudes that they ſhall diſtill no raine vpon my vine-yard.] Meaning by this kinde of ſpeech, his people whom he hath elected. And ſurely the holy ſpirit would giue vs to vnderſtand this one thing more in this text, that as the earth waxeth barren, if it be not watred by raine from heauen; ſo men cannot performe any thing, if God powre not downe his grace vpon them, as he cauſeth the raine-waters to ſhowre downe vpon the earth. Wherefore as it is vnfruitfull, not being watred from heauen: euen ſo is mankinde, when God withdraweth his bleſſing. For we are all curſed by nature, as the earth is, as we euen now heard the Apoſtle giue euidence.</p>
                  <p>When therefore it pleaſeth the creator, he commandeth the cloudes to diſtribute their waters, to the end that the earth may be moiſtned &amp; watred, to make it fertile. And therfore the kingly Prophet ſaith againe. [Thou viſiteſt the earth and watreſt it:<note place="margin">

and bleſſeſt the bud thereof. Thou crowneſt the yeere with thy goodnes, and thy ſteps drop fatnes.] Meaning by the ſteps or paths, and walkes of the Lord, the cloudes, for that the Scripture propoſeth him vnto vs, walking vpon them: and by fatnes he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the raine which droppeth vpon the earth, as it doth alſo ſerue therefore. And in another Pſalme he againe recordeth: [The Lord watreth the mountaines from his loftie chambers:] which is as much to ſay, as God cauſeth it to raine vpon the mountaines to make them fruitfull. And therefore he further addeth, [That the earth is filled with the fruit of his workes.] Wherein the Prophet doth alſo expound his owne meaning, ſaying before, that the Al-mightie laide the planchers of his high chambers amongſt the waters, and after that he hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally entreated of the fertilitie which God beſtoweth vpon the earth, by meanes of the raine, he doth declare it more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.</note> ſaying [He cauſeth graſſe to grow for the cattell, and herbe for the vſe of man, that he may bring foorth bread out of the earth; and wind that maketh glad the heart of man; and oyle that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the face to ſhine, and bread that ſtrengthneth mans heart. The high trees are ſatisfied, euen the Cedars of Libanon, which he hath planted. That the birds may make their neſts there: the Storke dwelleth in the firre-trees.] Where we cleerely behold how God ſendeth his bleſſing vpon the earth, by meanes of the raine, to the ende that it may bring foorth fruits, not onely for the nouriſhment of men; but alſo for the commoditie of beaſts. Which may ſerue vs for a certaine teſtimonie of his prouidence towards mankinde.<note place="margin">Teſtimony of the prouidence of God towards men.</note> For if he hath care of the bruit beaſts which he hath created for men; there is no doubt, but he hath much more care of them whom he hath created after his owne image and ſemblance, and aboue all, of his children and elect. And for this cauſe alſo the Pſalmiſt ſignifieth, how that God hath not onely beene carefull to prouide for their neceſſities, as for the neceſſities of other creatures; but it hath alſo pleaſed him to beſtowe vpon them pleaſures and honeſt comforts, conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent both for his Maieſtie, as alſo for the nature of man: when hee ſaith, that GOD hath giuen wine to man to make him merrie; and oyle to make his face ſhine. For although he alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die had the waters for drinke, and which might ſuffice him to ſtaunch his thirſt, and for his neceſſarie beuerage, it hath neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe pleaſed him through his great liberalitie to beſtow wine
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8737:125"/>
vpon him alſo, which is a much more delicious drinke, and which doth ſo comfort him, that it bringeth ioy &amp; pleaſure to him. And for oyle, it doth not onely ſerue in meates and medicinall oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but alſo to make compoſitions and ſweete ſauours, to beawtifie and refreſh mans countenance. Which ſpecialities the prophet would not omit: becauſe that in his daies oyle was in great vſe, to make ſuch precious ointments, as the auncients vſed to annoint themſelues withall, as is now adaies done with oyle of Spike, and other ſuch odoriferous oyles and ſweete water.<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.</note> And if God hath at ſome times multiplied by the hands of his faithfull miniſters the poore widowes oyle (as his worde teacheth vs) he cauſeth it to abound much more euerie day, when he maketh it encreaſe in the lands which he hath deſtinated to that purpoſe, conuerting the water, which runneth vpon the oliue trees into oyle: yea and that water, which droppeth vpon the earth into corne and bread, which he dayly doth much more abundantly multiply then in times paſt hee did the poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes meale by <hi>Elias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.</note> yea then Ieſus Chriſt did multiply the loaues in the wildernes. And therefore if we ſhall conſider how the Al-mightie creator of heauen &amp; earth cauſeth ſo many fruits to grow in this round-maſſe through the diſtillations of raine, and through the heate of the Sunne, wee hold in great admiration this woorthie naturall Alchimie, which he hath ſet before our eies in the nature by him created.<note place="margin">Of true naturall Alchymie.</note> For all this world is to him as a fornace, and a limbeck wherein he maketh ſo many goodlie and profitable diſtillations, that it is altogither impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in words their woorth and valew. The earth is this fornace, and all the plants and trees ſo many limbecks. And if we haue in ſuch eſtimation the diſtillations made by men following ſome imitation of nature, this ſurely is a kinde of Alchymy very woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of great reputation and woonder. For let vs conſider one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it is that hee extracteth out of a vine ſtocke and the branches. There is no doubt but that this is a plant of no great ſhew, ſo that many haue doubted whether it might rightfully be counted amongſt trees, for beſides that it is crooked, it is ſo weak that it cannot ſtand vpright, nor ſuſtaine not onely the branches thereof, but euen it ſelfe, if it be not alwaies propped, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when it riſeth neuer ſo little high: And yet this is a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and very rare Limbeck, wherein God conuerteth water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wine, and maketh it to diſtill out. The like may we ſaie of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8737:126"/>
Oliue-trees, figge-trees, and many other fruite-trees, ſauing that they make more ſhew, and retaine more of the nature of a tree, then the vine doth. For all the excellent liquors and fruits, which we draw out of theſe plants, and all others, are principally cauſed by the heat of the ſunne, and by the waterings of raine from heauen, which by this meanes ſeemeth to change nature, and put on diuers formes. And yet this ſun, by meanes of whom, as by a fire, God performeth ſo many ſundry and admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions and diſtillations, hath not his face ſmeared with coles, to kindle and maintaine his fire, nor yet his faire eie ſoiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or with any ſmoke. So then I hold them very wiſe, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in the contemplation of this Alchymie, and emploie their time and cunning therein, as husbandmen do who till the earth, attending in good hope after their trauell, the bleſſing which is promiſed them of God, as he alſo doth daily ſend vpon the earth by the effects of the ſunne, moone, ſtars, and planets; of the aire, clouds, raine, and ſuch other meanes which it pleaſeth him to vſe for the ſame purpoſe.<note place="margin">

&amp; doubts are great &amp; vncertaine amongſt them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the philoſophers. Yet that is the onely truth, which the diuine poet teacheth vs, ſaying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.</note> [That the Lord draweth the windes out of his treaſures.] <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Meteors maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the windes are produced by the heate of the ſunne: which it ſeemeth that the author of the naturall hiſtorie doth contradict when he ſaith, that there are certaine caues wherein the windes are ordinarily engendred, as may be ſeene in a deepe pit, which is in the coaſtes of Dalmatia at Senta, wherein if one caſt any thing, how light ſoeuer it be, there iſſueth ſodainelie out a whirle-winde, although the weather be neuer ſo calme and faire. And in many obſcure places in houſes, one ſhall commonly feele a certaine ſmall winde, as if it were encloſed therein. But we muſt note that there is much difference betwixt theſe particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, or ſmall puffes cauſed by exhalations, which proceed out of the earth, and that, which is properly named the winde. For they are not felt in one place onely, but haue their courſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally through all the earth, and their meanes limited therein to exerciſe their power.<note place="margin">Diuers opinions concerning the generation of windes.</note> And therefore whether the winde be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by continual motion of the heauen, or by the croſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the planets, which goe contrarie to that of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe that the winde be an aire driuen by the ſundry tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the ſpheres, and by the multiplicitie of the beames of the celeſtiall ſignes, or elſe that it proceed from ſtars particularly appointed to ingender it; or from the fixed ſtarres (for all theſe opinions are found amongſt Philoſophers:) yet neuertheleſſe we ſee by experience, that the winde is ſubiect to the rules and lawes of nature, &amp; that it hath his determinate courſe, although mans wit cannot pierce to ſound the reaſon of this ſecret.</p>
                  <p>But for the names and ſpecies of theſe windes, they haue am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie entreated thereof. True it is that the ancients made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but of fower windes, which they compriſed vnder the fower parts of the world. And then the naturall Philoſophers appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twelue, giuing them names taken partly from the regions from which they proceeded, and partly from the effects and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which they cauſe vpon the earth. But the Hydrographers and marriners account ſixteene.<note place="margin">Of the names, and kindes of the windes.</note> To haue the vnderſtanding of which, wee muſt note that euery horizon is diuided into fower quarters by two right lines, which croſſe in the center thereof: the one of which is correſpondent to the Meridian circle, and the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8737:127"/>
other to the verticall circle, which diuideth the ſame Meridian at right angles, which lines demonſtrate the fower principall parts of the earth, that is, the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South part: of which proceed the fower principall windes, to wit, out of the Septentrionall part, the North winde: from the Meridionall the ſouth: from the Orientall the Eaſt: and from the Occidentall the Weſt: Betweene which are other middle and notable windes, whoſe names are compounded of thoſe of the fower foreſaide windes, and are therefore called North-eaſt, North-weſt; South-eaſt, and South-weſt. Then againe each diſtinction of theſe eight windes, is conſequently diuided into two equall parts, which make the diſtinctions of eight other windes, called ſub-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and which compound their names of their two next colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall windes, expreſſing the moſt notable firſt: to wit, North-northeaſt, North-northweſt; South-ſoutheaſt, South-ſouthweſt; Eaſt-northeaſt, Eaſt-ſoutheaſt; Weſt-northweſt, Weſt-ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt. Moreouer they that frequent the Mediterran ſea (as Greekes and Italians) do cal the north Tranſmontano: the ſouth, Auſtro: eaſt, Leuante: weſt, Ponante: northeaſt, Greco: north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, Maeſtro: ſoutheaſt, Sirocho: ſouthweſt, Garbin: and ſo of them compound the names of the other eight windes, which are betwixt them, as hath beene before declared. And we muſt note that the windes haue commonly euery one their turne in ſuch ſort that when one oppoſite wind ceaſeth and is laid, his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie riſeth.<note place="margin">Notable things in the windes.</note> But if at any time the next winde to that which cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, begin to blowe, it runs byas-wiſe from left hand to right, as the ſun doth, and one may know the fourth daie of the moone, what winde will raigne longeſt during her time. But the eaſterne windes do longer endure then thoſe which riſe towards the weſt. And the ſunne doth ſtrengthen the winde, and alſo appeaſe it: for at his riſing &amp; ſetting they are commonly greateſt, at noone he calmeth them, eſpecially in ſommer. The winde is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found to lie ſtill, either at midday, or at midnight: for it doth alwaies ceaſe either through great colde, or through vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heate. Likewiſe the raine doth make it ceaſe: whereupon this prouerbe ſprung vp, that little raine allaieth much winde.</p>
                  <p>But it is woondrous, that the windes, which are as it were but a puffe, ſhould performe ſuch things as men could not doe with their hands, yea though there were a multitude togither. For how many people neede there be, yea horſes and oxen yoked togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8737:127"/>
to breake, burſt, and pull vp the great and mightie trees, which the winde abateth, ouerturneth, breaketh, and rooteth vp, with a blaſt onely? And herein we haue goodly matter againe,<note place="margin">Teſtimonies of the diuine om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie in the windes.</note> whereby to profite in the acknowledgement of the ſoueraigne maieſtie and almightie prouidence of the creator and gouernour of all nature. For it is certaine, that as the Lord manifeſteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to men, ſuch as they may comprehend him to be, when he calleth the ſound and noiſe of thunder (his voice) that he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth admirable things, as we haue alreadie noted: we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that he doth the like alſo by violence of the windes. And therefore the prophet ſaith, [I know that the Lord is great, and that our God is aboue all Gods. Whatſoeuer pleaſed the Lord,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.</note> that did he in heauen and in earth, in the ſea, and in all the depths. He bringeth vp the cloudes from the ends of the earth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the lightnings with the raine; he draweth foorth the winde out of his treaſures.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ierem.</hi> 10.</note>] It is he (ſaith <hi>Ieremie</hi>) that giueth by his voice the multitude of waters in the heauen, and he cauſeth the cloudes to aſcend from the ends of the earth, he caſteth out lightnings in the raine, and bringeth foorth the windes out of his treaſures. [The winde (ſaith the Preacher) goeth towarde the ſouth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.</note> and compaſſeth toward the north: the winde goeth round about, and returneth by his circuits.] Now if the blaſts of the winds be ſo ſtrong, it muſt needes be, that the bellowes out of which they are blowen muſt be puiſſant and mightie. For although it is written of the wicked,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.</note> that they are ſo proud and doe preſume ſo much of their force and power, that they ſeeme to be able to ouerthrow men, townes, and fortified places onely with a blaſt; yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles it is the Lord, who hath the power to abate them, and all the loftie and ſtout with all their forts and bulwarks: For all the windes togither, are but as one little puffe, which paſſeth from his mouth. Wherefore if in breathing onely, he driueth and remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth heauen, earth, and the ſea, and all this world, performing actes ſo great and woonderfull: what may we eſteeme of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne force, when he would imploy his whole power? For there is neither winde nor thunder, nor deluges of water, nor any thing that is comparable to the wrath of God, and to the power which he hath to execute his vengeance vpon his enemies. But he emploieth his creatures, as the miniſters of his wrath, when, and how he pleaſeth. And therefore the diuine poet in his canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, wiſhing liuely to deſcribe the aſſiſtance that God had

For as there is a greater accord between the two elements of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and aire, then of aire and earth; euen ſo is there a more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencie of nature between fiſhes and foules, then between beaſts of the earth and foules. For the flying of birds in the aire is like the ſwimming of fiſhes in the water. Moreouer there are many water-foules, which are as it were of a middle nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thoſe which conuerſe but only in the aire, or in the earth, and which therein receiue their nouriture, and betweene the fiſhes that liue in the waters. For theſe birds flie in the aire like other birds, and ſwim alſo in the water like fiſhes, and liue partly in the water and partly in the aire. But before we intreate parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of theſe things, it ſeemeth good to me to note vpon the beginning of our diſcourſe concerning liuing creatures, that there are two principall kindes of liuing creatures,<note place="margin">Of two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall kindes of beaſts.</note> the firſt are thoſe, which haue life in euery part being diuided and cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, called in Latine (Inſecta) bicauſe of the inciſions which they ſeeme to haue vpon their bodies, and which are ingendred of putrifaction.

And for the perfect,<note place="margin">Of nine kindes of perfect beaſts.</note> there are found nine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall kindes of them, whereof ſome remaine onely in the aire, and haue no feet, as the bird called (Manucodiata:) other conuerſe in

                     <note place="margin">Of the bird na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Manuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diata.</note>Now to begin with the birds according as the order of our treatiſe doth require, we will ſpeake of the Manucodiata, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the birde of God, or of paradiſe, according to the interpretation of the Indian name, which birde is found dead vpon the earth, or in the ſea, in the Iſles named The Malucos, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is neuer ſeene aliue out of the aire: For this birde onely hath no feete, for that it abideth aloft in the aire, and farre out of mans ſight, hauing the body and beake like a ſwallow, both in bignes and forme. The feathers of his wings and taile, are longer then thoſe of a ſparrow-hawke, but very ſlender, agreeable to the ſmalenes of the bird. The back of the cock is holow, whereby reaſon ſheweth, that the hen layeth her egges in this hollownes, ſeeing that ſhe hath the like creuiſe in her belly, ſo that by means of both theſe pits ſhe may hatch her egges. The meate of this foule is the dewe of heauen, which ſerueth it for meate &amp; drinke: it neuer faileth, but through age onely: and ſo long as they liue they ſuſtaine themſelues with their owne wings, and their taile being ſpred out in a roundnes: by which meanes it doth more commodiouſly inhabite in the aire.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of Eagles. Hiſt. nat. lib. 10.</note>Next I proceed to the birds which conuerſe in the aire, and in the earth: of which the Eagle for greatnes and ſtrength bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth away the price. <hi>Plinie</hi> ſetteth downe ſixe kindes; of which the leaſt in body, called the blacke eagle, is ſtrongeſt, and it of all others doth onely nouriſh her eaglets. For all the reſt chaſe and driue away their yoong ones, bicauſe that when they haue them, their nailes and clawes are turned vpſide downe, as if nature woulde declare hirſelfe very prouident in this, to depriue the eagle of al meanes to helpe it ſelfe with any more purchaſe, then will euen ſerue her owne turne; for otherwiſe it woulde deſtroy all the yoong veniſon of a countrey: therefore through hunger which by this occaſion they do then ſuſtaine, they become white
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8737:129"/>
and hate their yoong ones. But the Oſſifragi, which are another ſort of wilde eagles, doe, as diuers affirme, gather togither the yoong eaglets which their dam hath expelled, and doe nouriſh them with their owne. And eagles neuer die through age, or any other malady but for hunger onely, their vppermoſt beak grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great and ſo crooked, that it is impoſſible for them to open their mouthes to feede themſelues. Their feathers being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the feathers of other birds, do deuoure and conſume them.</p>
                  <p>The Phenix is ſaid to be found in no other place of the world but only in Arabia, &amp; is very ſeldome ſeen. It is as big as an eagle,<note place="margin">Of the Phenix.</note> and the plumes of her taile are guilded, being intermixed with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine blew and carnation feathers, the reſt of her body being of a purple colour. She hath her head decked with exquiſite plumes, and with a tuft of very goodly feathers. She liueth ſixe hundred and ſixtie yeeres, as <hi>Manilius</hi> a Senator of Rome recordeth, and ſo <hi>Plinie</hi> doth make report. And feeling herſelfe aged,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat lib. 10.</note> ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her neſt with peeces of cynamon and incenſe, and hauing filled it with all ſorts of aromaticall odors, ſhe dieth thereupon. And out of her marrow and bones there commeth firſt a worme, which afterward turneth to a little birde, that in time prooueth another Phenix.</p>
                  <p>Some report almoſt the very ſame of a birde called Semen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, which is found in the midſt of India, which hath her bill clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into three parts, boared and pearced euery where through, and ſhe ſingeth at her death as the ſwan doth. Afterward by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her wings ſhe kindleth a fire made of the twigs of a vine, which ſhe gathereth togither, wherewith ſhe is burned, and of her aſhes there is a worme engendred, of which ſpringeth againe another like birde.</p>
                  <p>Swans are birds cleane white, and differ but little from geeſe,<note place="margin">Of Swans.</note> except in bignes. They ſing ſweetelier then any other foules.

the countrey. Euery troupe hath a captaine, who is alwaies in the rereward: at whoſe onely crie all the reſt do obey and do keepe their rankes and order; and each of them taketh his place by turnes. They do alſo ſet their night watch, and keepe ſentinell one after another. The ſentinell ſtandeth vpon one foote onely, holding a little ſtone in the other, to the end, that if he happen to ſleepe, the ſtone which falleth out of his paw might waken him. All the reſt do this while ſleepe, hauing their head vnder their wing, keeping watch neuertheles, ſometimes vpon one foote, ſometimes vpon another. But their captaine holdeth his head alwaies in the aire, to make ſigne to the reſt, of what they are to doe.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of Quailes.</note>Quailes are alſo a kinde of flying foules, very ſmall of body, but ſingular in diuers properties. They ſoare not very high in the aire in theſe countries, but flie neere to the ground. They flie in troupes, and that ſometimes to the great danger of thoſe which ſaile vpon the ſea, or are neere the ground: For theſe birdes doe pearch in ſo great number by night vpon the ſailes, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſinke barkes and ſmall veſſels. They know their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie pearches, and do neuer flie abroad in a ſouth winde, bicauſe it is too heauie, and too moiſt: and yet they muſt of neceſſitie be
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:8737:130"/>
aided by the winde, to performe their voyage, by reaſon that their bodies are more heauie then their wings can ſuſtaine. And therefore they hang their wings, as if they were pained with fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So then they make choiſe of the northerne winde for their comming: And when they retire themſelues, they aſſemble their troupes. If the winde be contrarie to them, they ſwallow much grauell, and take little ſtones in their tallents, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more heauie, that they may not be caried away by the winde.</p>
                  <p>Swallowes alſo are a kinde of wilde fowle,<note place="margin">Of Swallowes.</note> for they go away in winter. But they retire not themſelues verie far off, but keepe in thoſe coaſts which are warmed with the Sunne, many are ſeene bare and vnfledged. This bird onely, of all thoſe that haue not crooked clawes, doth feed on fleſh. One may put in the number of wilde fowles, Blacke-birdes, Thruſhes, Stares,<note place="margin">Other wilde foules.</note> Ringdoues and Pigeons, although they vſe not to retire to farre countries. But they mew not as others doe, neither keepe themſelues cloſe, for they are vſually ſeene in the countrey where they winter. The propertie of Stares is to go in a great troupe together, and to flie in a round, euerie one of them endeuouring to gaine the middle place. The ſwallow onely of all other birds flieth askew, &amp; is paſſing quick of wing; ſo likewiſe is it hardeſt of all birds to be taken. Moreouer it is peculiar to hir, not to feed but in flying. Thus then you ſee what I thought to deduce briefly concerning wilde-fowle. You ASER ſhall proſecute the diſcourſe of this matter.</p>

To declare, that it is verie difficult (if not altogether impoſſible)
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:8737:131"/>
to make any thing liue in what place ſoeuer,<note place="margin">Rarenes, and changes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny birdes.</note> againſt the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of nature. So it was, that in the whole Iſle of Rhodes there could not be found one only neſt of an Eagle, though that in the neighbouring territories there were ynough. So though the lake of Como, which is on the other ſide of the riuer Po in Italy, be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plentiful in fruit trees &amp; faire paſturage: yet for all this there cannot be found within eight miles almoſt one ſtorke. It is ſaid alſo, that in all Tarentum there is not one Wood-pecker to be found. And in the territory of Athe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the partridges paſſe not the limits of Boeotia: So in Mar Maggiore, or the Euxine ſea, there is no fowle ſeene. And in Volaterra the ring-doues are ſeene to come euerie yeere in great vollies ouer the ſea. But beſides all this, there is great difference in ſeaſons for birdes: for ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere all the yeere long; others ſhew themſelues but halfe the yeere; &amp; ſome are ſeen abroad but three moneths. Some alſo go away preſently after they haue hatched and brought vp their yoong ones. But aboue all, there are maruellous things found in ſinging birdes. For ſome there are which chaunge their feathers and their note, one ſeaſon of the yeere; ſo that one would ſay, they were quite other birdes: which happeneth not to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fowles, except to the crane, which waxeth blacke in age. Black-birds,<note place="margin">Of blackbirdes.</note> which are naturally blacke, being old, become of a reddiſh colour. They ſing in ſommer; in winter they doe but chatter; and are altogether dumbe, when the daies begin to lengthen, as about mid-December: and the cockes of a yeere old, haue an iuorie white bill. Thruſhes haue their necke parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured in ſommer, but in winter it is all of one colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</note>But amongſt ſinging birdes the nightingal is moſt admirable. For it is a miracle that ſo ſhrill a voice can proceed out of ſo ſmall a bodie, and that it can hold breath ſo long. Moreouer, it hath a verie harmonious note, and perfectly muſicall. For ſometimes ſhee draweth out her notes long, another while ſhee quauers; ſtraightwaies ſhe cuts her tune ſhort; and then ſhe will warble, as if it were by muſicall crotchets. Another time ſhe will whiſtle producing her notes with one breath, by and by quickning her tune, as if it were by ſemibriefes: ſometimes abaſing hir voice, preſently raiſing it, and by and by after cutting it thicke and ſhort. Sometimes alſo ſhe will make the points of the organes, lifting her voice high like a pipe, when ſhe liſteth, obſeruing ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the treble, ſometimes the baſe, and ſometimes the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenour.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8737:131"/>
Finally, there is no inſtrument in the world, wherein one may finde more perfect muſicke, then this which reſoundeth in ſo ſmall a throat. And that which merits greater maruell in this bird, is, that there are many ſongs all different, and that euerie nightingall hath her owne in particular. So alſo they debate amongſt themſelues who ſhall ſing beſt, contending heerein one againſt another: ſo that ſometimes the vanquiſhed ceaſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through want of breath, then of ſong. And the yoong little nightingals hearken to the olde, and doe record by themſelues apart the ſongs which they heard, from point to point: ſo that theſe diſciples, after they haue attentiuely hearkened, doe repeat the leſſon which they haue learned, &amp; then ceaſe. Then may one heare the reprehenſions of the ſchoolemaſter, and may very well diſcerne when the ſcholler is waxt cunning. Moreouer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of their ſinging doth not commonly endure aboue fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene daies and fifteene nights: all which time they ſing without ceaſing: and that is when the trees begin to waxe thick of leaues in ſpring-time. And afterwards this great melodie beginneth by little and little to ceaſe: and yet not ſo, that one may perceiue them to be wearie of their ſinging. And when the heat begins to trouble them, they whiſtle not as before, but change their voice and ſing a full note. They alſo mew and change feathers. To conclude, they retire themſelues in winter like all other wilde fowle.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Finches and linnets are numbred amongſt thoſe little birds, that ſing verie harmoniouſly,<note place="margin">Of finches, and linnets, parrats, and pies.</note> and eaſily retaine that which is taught them, whether it be in voice, or by any demonſtration that they may imitate either in foote or bill. But aboue all birds, parrats do moſt counterfeit the voice and ſpeech of man. They come from the Indies, and haue commonly their feathers greene, except onely a coller of red vermilion feathers that compaſſeth their neck: this bird ſpeaketh all that which one will take paines to teach her. It loueth wine much, and hauing well drunke, is much pleaſanter. There is likewiſe a kinde of Pies which do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce better that which is taught them, then the parrats doe: yet are they not ſo much accounted of, becauſe they are ordinarie with vs. They take pleaſure in the words which they ſpeake, and do ſo delight in them, that one ſhall often finde them ſtudying verie attentiuely by themſelues, that which hath beene ſhewed them.

It happened that a certaine ſpitefull neighbour of this ſhooemaker, taking occaſion for that this crow had muted vpon ſome of his ware, did kill it. Whereat the people tooke ſuch indignation, that they cauſed this poore merchant to loſe his life: preparing on the other ſide verie magnificent funerals for the birde. For the carcaſſe thereof was couered ouer with noſegaies and chaplets of flowers, and borne by two Mores to the fire, which was kindled in a voide place, there to burne it ſolemnly; ſo much was the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this crowe eſteemed in a citie, where many princes and great perſonages had died before, and none woulde ſolemnize their funerals: and wherein there was none that would reuenge the death of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> though he had conquered the Carthaginians and Numantines.</p>

And if perhaps the drines of the weather will not miniſter dirt enough for them, then they load themſelues with water, which they ſhake vpon the ground, to moiſten the duſt, and to make ſlime.

                  <p>AS we haue heeretofore heard of a birde that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer abideth vpon the earth; ſo contrariwiſe the Eſtridge doth alwaies ſtaie vpon the earth,<note place="margin">Of the Eſtridge.</note> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer mounting aloft to take the aire. This is as bigge a birde as any other, &amp; is common in Africa, &amp; in Aethiopia. It hath a long necke like a camell; the beake, eies, and head like to a gooſe, but that they are much greater: their wings &amp; taile haue feathers of diuers colours, skie-coloured, white, red, blacke and greene, and there is no birde which hath ſuch faire plumes, of which thoſe fethers are made wherewith men of warre adorne their helmets.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:8737:133"/>
The Eſtridges paſſe horſes in ſwiftnes, being herein aided with the wings which Nature hath beſtowed vpon them, although they fly not at al, neither riſe from the ground, but run with their wings ſpread. They haue clouen feete like an hart: with which (men ſay) they vſe to take vp and caſt ſtones at thoſe which chaſe them when they flie. It is alſo ſaid that they ſwallow and digeſt iron: which commeth to paſſe through the vehement heat and thicknes of their belly. Some alſo haue reported, that the Eſtridge hatcheth her egges with her eies: but the truth is, that ſhe onely watcheth them; becauſe that her yoong ones are brought foorth by the heat of the ſunne. The manner of taking this birde is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie eaſie; for when he is wearie of running, he is of ſo fooliſh a nature, that he thinketh himſelfe cloſely hidden, when he is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſhade of ſome tree or ſhrub; ſo that it is then eaſie to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch him ſo neere as the purſuer will deſire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the peacock.</note>But let vs ſpeake of the birde, which for the beautie and ſenſe which it hath, doth merit the chiefe degree amongſt the greater ſort of birdes; to wit, the Peacocke. For when he knowes that men eſteeme him, then turneth he round to ſhew his colours ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like pretious ſtones, and ſets them directly againſt the ſun, to giue them a better luſtre. And he aſſayeth alſo to doe ſo with his taile, ſpreading it round and ſhewing thoſe colours, which ſeeme faireſt in the ſhade, drawing all the eies thereof abroad, as if he knew beſt how to make himſelfe moſt noted. Alſo when he hath loſt his taile (as he doth euery yeere at the fal of the leafe) he hideth himſelf, as if he mourned, til the next ſpring, when his taile groweth againe. It is maruellous that this part of the peacocke is ſo filled with eies, being ſo long &amp; thick of feathers of ſundrie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, &amp; ſo ſplenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; &amp; yet neither the colour of white nor of black (this being of it ſelfe ſad, and that obſcuring all colours) are found in the taile of this birde. Which bird liueth ordinarily fiue and twentie yeeres; and at three yeeres he beginneth to ſhoote the ſundrie colours which he hath in his feathers, and knoweth his beautie: and ſeemeth to reioyce that men do maruell at his taile when they ſee it, and therefore he will hold it vp, be he neuer ſo wearie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Cock.</note>Next to the proude nature of the peacocke, that loftie birde ſeemeth to reſemble a Sentinell, which Nature hath appointed to interrupt mens ſleepe and call them to worke, that is, the Cocke. For whereſoeuer he is he will be maſter, and commaund all the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:8737:133"/>
reſt of the foules. And if there bee two togither, then muſt this rule remaine to the ſtrongeſt, and he muſt get it by thoſe weapons which Nature hath placed in his legs: wherein they put ſuch truſt, that the iſſue of their combate, doth oftentimes fall out with the death of the one or other. And he which remaineth victor, makes ſigne of his conqueſt by his crowing, ſounding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe his owne tantaraes: and the vanquiſhed runnes and hides himſelfe. This loftie bird marcheth proudly, holding vp his neck ſtiffe, and his combe aloft, except he be not well. And there is no birde which doth oftner caſt his eie towards heauen, then this: for he alwaies beholdeth it, holding his taile vp, and yet crooked like a ſickle: ſo that arming himſelfe after this manner, he puts the Lion in feare, which is the ſtouteſt of all beaſts. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the cocke by a ſecret inſtinct of nature knoweth the courſe of the ſtars, and diuideth the day by his crowing from three ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers to three howers. They rouſt at ſunne ſet, and neuer let the ſunne riſe, without aduertiſing men: for with their crowing, which is accompanied with beating of their wings, they giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the day. And their voice is heard very farre off, yea in the night time a mile, or more. The Romanes honored ſo much the maieſtie of this bird, that they iudged of the good or euill lucke of their Augurations, by the countenance which he ſhewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either pleaſant or not, at ſuch time as he fed.</p>
                  <p>Hens are of the kinde of domeſticall birds,<note place="margin">Of hens.</note> renowmed aboue all for the delicatenes of their fleſh, and goodnes of their egges, beeing much better then all other, and which are moſt vſed in meates and medicines. They lay at all times, except the two firſt moneths of winter, when they commonly reſt themſelues: So is it the firſt and laſt bird that layeth; and is ſo fruitfull, that there are ſome will lay ſixtie egges together, without miſſing one day. Whereupon wee will note that in all yolkes of egges, there is a little drop of bloud in the middeſt, which is holden to be the heart of the bird, becauſe this member is eſteemed to bee firſt formed in all liuing creatures. And indeed this little drop taſteth very ſalt, and ſtirreth in the egge. And for that which particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the chicken, it is certaine that the bodie thereof is made of the white of the egge: for being formed, it is nouriſhed by the yolke. And ſo long as it is in the ſhell, it hath the head bigger then all the bodie, and the eies, which are ſhut, bigger then the head. And when it beginneth to growe, the white of the egge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireth
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:8737:134"/>
to the midſt, and the yolke diſperſeth it ſelfe round about: And if at the twentith day one take the egge, they may heare the chicken peepe within. For from that time forward it beginneth to waxe feathered, and to get ſtrength: and ſtaieth not long in conſuming the whole yolke, but preſently beginneth to open the ſhell. And it is to be noted, that as well this as all other foules, come out of their ſhels with their feete forwardes, contrarie to other liuing creatures. Moreouer the hen is knowne to be good, when hir creſt is ſtraight, and ſometimes double, and hir feathers blacke, and in ſome places red: as alſo when the clawes of her foote are faire. But aboue all there is nothing more woorthie of great admiration, then the care which it taketh to hatch and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hir chickens: yea though they be not of hir owne kinde. And it is a pretie paſtime to make an hen hatch ducke-egges: For at firſt when they open the ſhell, ſhe knoweth them not; and neuertheles hauing beene a little accuſtomed to them, ſhe doth nouriſh them as carefully as if they were naturally her owne. And when theſe yoong duckes, according to their kinde, caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the water, it is a woonder to ſee the mourning of the hen, fearing leaſt ill ſhould betide them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the pigeon.</note>The pigeon likewiſe is an houſe-bird much to be conſidered of, and bringeth no leſſe profit and commoditie then pullen doe. It is very chaſte by nature, and neuer changeth mate neither cocke nor hen: and yet the cocks are very rude towards the hens, beating them with their bils, and chiding them with a kinde of grumbling in their throat, as if they were iealous: But afterwards as if they repented themſelues, they make much of them, and bill togither, running round about them, and ſpecially when their time of treading is come. Both cocke and hen take great paines to hatch their yoong ones: inſomuch that when the hens are idle, and tarie not in the neſt, the cockes will correct and beate them with their beakes. But they doe likewiſe aide them, as well hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them to make their neſts, as to ſerue them while they hatch: yea and the cocke doth ſometimes hatch in the day-time. It is their propertie to bill togither before they tread. And they lay ordinarily two egges, out of which iſſue both cocke and hen, that is, the cocke firſt, and the hen the morrow after. They hatch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eighteene or twentie daies, and breede after fiue times treading. And one ſhall ſometimes finde egges with little pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them: and ſhall ſee in one neſt ſome yoong ones but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8737:134"/>
out of the ſhell, and ſome that are ready to flie. They may lay egges eight or ten times a yeere: but the ordinarie vſe is to take out fower good layings. They are of ſundrie colours of feathers, but the aſhcoloured, or the browne, or the blacke are beſt: the rough footed, and tufted are moſt barren and domeſticall: ſo are the blacke and white checkered: but thoſe that ſeeme guilded about the necke, and that haue the eie and foote redde, are the freeſt and fruitfulleſt: the white are good to hatch, and moſt in danger of the kite, and birds of pray: the yealow and red are very barren. They haue all this maruailous qualitie, to giue their young ones at firſt ſome corne of ſalt grauell, ſo to prouoke their appetite, and ſeaſon them to eat, when time ſhall bee. Now mee thinketh, wee haue ſtaied long enough in this matter, ſith we will not heere deſcribe a naturall hiſtorie of creatures: and ſith that which wee haue diſcourſed concerning fowles, hath beene onely for that wee will not depriue the aire of the naturall creatures thereof; as wee will endeuour to do the like in the behalfe of the earth and water: whereof the ſequele of our ſpeech requireth vs to entreat, to accompliſh our diſcourſe concerning the elements. Firſt then let vs ſpeake of the earth, and of the firmenes, figure and quantitie thereof. And it is your turne (ARAM) to diſcourſe thereupon.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Scituation of the earth.</note>Now it is certaine, that by reaſon of the waight and heauines of the earth, it is neceſſarily ſituated in the midſt of the world, as the center thereof, being the loweſt place, and the fartheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the circumference of the whole. And from which the earth cannot be parted, (for otherwiſe it ſhould mount aloft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the naturall inclination thereof) as likewiſe it cannot be mooued by the firſt and vniuerſall motion of all the ſpheres, by reaſon of the foreſaid heauines thereof, and ſubtilitie of the other elements, which are about it: and againe bicauſe it is of inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible quantitie in reſpect of the whole world, as being the point and center thereof, being alſo vnmooueable, to the end that the motion of the heauens might thereby bee diſcerned, and that which dependeth thereupon.<note place="margin">Immobility of the earth.</note> And as the ſeate of the elementarie fire doth not extend beyond the fire, and as that of the water is in the place of water, and that of the aire where the aire ſhould be: ſo the earth can retaine no place but in it ſelfe; bicauſe that the other elements cannot ſuffer it to reſt vpon them. Which cauſeth that it remaineth hanged amongſt them, not being able to fall, nor decline more towards one place, then another. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo it is made habitable in euery part (except it be by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:<note place="margin">The earth habi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</note>) ſo that men are therefore Antipodes one to another, that is, going feete againſt feete, hauing neuertheles all of them their heads towards heauen, and meeting each of them in the midſt of the earth. Now that it is iuſtly ſituate in the midſt of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, one may ſee by experience of the daies and nights, which are equall throughout the whole earth, ſo often as the ſunne is in the midſt of heauen betwixt the poles of the worlde; as alſo by the augmentations and diminutions of the ſame daies and nights regularly proportioned one to another (as we haue demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

as well on the meridionall, as on the ſeptentrionall part.<note place="margin">That the earth is round.</note> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer there is no doubt, but the earth (togither with the whole element of water, which is ſpread abroad and diſperſed in diuers armes, and portions about it) is of a round and circular figure in all parts: for as for the mountaines &amp; valleies they are inſenſible in regard of the whole globe of earth. The roundnes whereof doth euidently declare it ſelfe by the ſhadow thereof, which ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it ſelfe in the eclipſes of the moone to be round: for it could not ſeeme ſo, if the earth were not alſo of the ſame forme.

For in a little ſpace that one may paſſe here vpon the earth procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from one place to another, the view and diſpoſition of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doth change and varie notably. And in an open plaine place wherein one may ſtand vpon the earth, or be in the ſea, they may alwaies diſcouer the one halfe of heauen. All which things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare (as we haue ſaid) that the earth and the water make a round globe, which is but as a point and center in regard of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall world.</p>
                  <p>So much for the ſituation, immobilitie, figure,<note place="margin">That the earth onely meriteth the title of a mother.</note> and quantitie of the earth; which onely aboue all other elements hath meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the title of a mother, by reaſon of the great good which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foordeth to all breathing &amp; liuing creatures.

For the water conuerts it ſelfe into raine, ſnowe, and haile; it ſwelleth in ſurges and waues, and ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all with flouds; the aire thickeneth and ladeth it ſelfe with cloudes, out of which proceede ſtormes and tempeſts; and the fire is often cauſe of ſtrange calamities vpon earth: But this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and debonaire mother maketh hir ſelfe as a ſlaue to ſerue for all the commodities of man. For how many things doe we cauſe hir to beare by force, and how many things doth ſhe beſtowe of hir owne goodwill? What odours and perfumes, what ſauours, what iuices, what, and how many ſorts of colours? With what exchaunge and intereſt doth ſhee reſtore that, which is lent hir?

And it hath often hapned in ſuch caſes, that ſome mountaines haue fallen one againſt another, bicauſe the earth, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them hath ſunck, and beene ſwallowed cleane vp. And then one might ſay, that the prouerb is not euer true, which ſaith, that two mountaines neuer meet. There is yet another kinde of motion, wherein the earth mooueth and ſhaketh, ſometimes one way, ſometimes another way, and tottereth like a ſhip that floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the water. Which kinde of trembling is moſt dangerous: as alſo when all the motion runneth one way. Then is there yet another motion, which philoſophers properly call (trembling) to wit, when two motions are oppoſite one to another, as if two rammes ſhould ruſh one againſt another. And this is leaſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of all: although indeede they bee all very fearefull, yet the feare is much greater, when the tremblings continue with horrible and fearefull ſounds, like the bellowing of buls, and as if the earth and all nature quaked and groaned, beeing ſore preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and forced, as is oftentimes ſeene.</p>

                        </gap> the cauſes of earthquakes.</note>Now for the cauſes of all theſe kindes of earthquakes, I may well ſay, that there is no point in all naturall philoſophie, wherein the profeſſors of this ſcience finde themſelues more intricately intangled, nor wherein they more differ in opinions then in this. For the Chaldeans and Aſtronomers referre the cauſes of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and earthquakes, to the heauen, to the ſtarres, and to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and many philoſophers aſſigne it to the water: And yet thoſe, which are of this opinion differ amongſt themſelues. For ſome ſuppoſe that the earth floateth vpon the water like a ſhip,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8737:137"/>
bicauſe it is enuironed with water, according to the naturall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the diſpoſition of the elements: whereby it is diuerſly mooued. Others doe attribute the cauſe of earthquakes to thoſe waters onely which are incloſed within the vaines and caues of the earth. Some alſo to the fire: and ſome to the windes ſhut vp within it: and ſome to the heate chaſed by the colde, which ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth againſt it, and cauſeth it to ſearch an iſſue out. For as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vndermineth the earth, and thoſe places through which it doth paſſe: euen ſo may the fire doe: and if either of them be ſo incloſed, that they cannot finde an eaſie iſſue, they ſtriue then to doe it by force and violence. So doe the windes, and the heate chaſed by the cold. So then, if the earth be vndermined, it is no maruell if the vpper part ſinke and fall downe, being ſwallowed vp, as into a gulfe, conſidering that the earth, bicauſe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines thereof, tendeth alwaies downward towardes the center thereof, which is the midſt of it, and of all the worlde. And if the waters, or the fire, or the windes incloſed and ſhut vp in the earth, or the contrarie qualities, which contend one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot finde a paſſage or iſſue, their power is ſo great, that they conſtraine the earth, which reſiſteth them, and by forcing it, make it to cleaue and open, and to remooue, and to ſhake in thoſe places, wherein it is forced: Concerning all which things one may make a neere coniecture,<note place="margin">Of the force, and violence in artillerie.</note> by the force and violence which is ſeene in ordinance and artillerie. For euery one behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth what force there is by meanes of fire, and of the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within, to wit, powder, and of the contrarie qualities wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is compounded, and of the winde that therein is ingendred, not onely to driue out with maruellous violence all the charge that therein is, but alſo many times to burſt the peece it ſelfe, if there be any reſiſtance to hinder it that it diſcharge not quickly, or if it be not well made, and very ſtrong, and well proportioned to the charge. We behold alſo, what a winde there iſſueth out, and what noiſe it maketh, and how the noiſe makes the earth to ſound and tremble: and oftentimes it happeneth, that this onely winde killeth thoſe that ſtand neere the cannons mouth, ſuch is the violence thereof, although they be not touched at all with the bullet, that it ſhooteth. But wee beholde more cleerely in mines, which are made vnder ground, the violence of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when it is therein incloſed with the fire, which is ſet thereto by traines. For there is neither towne nor caſtle, be they neuer ſo
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8737:138"/>
well founded, nor any fortreſſe, which is not onely ſhaken, but ouerturned alſo, like as by an horrible earth-quake. Wherein we may note, how that it hath not beene ſufficient for men, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit thunders, and lightnings in artillerie, but they haue alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented the meanes to repreſent the motions and ſhakings of the earth: in ſuch manner as we haue ſignified. There are ſome phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers alſo,<note place="margin">Earthquakes compared to agues.</note> who haue taught, that the ſame reaſon is in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, as there is in the ſhaking of mens bodies: and that they are like feuers and maladies of the earth, which come vnto it through diuers cauſes, ſaue that they hold not all the bodie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as they doe in men, but onely ſome partes of it. For they argue that the water is in the earth, as the blood, which hath his courſe through the vaines of mans bodie; and the winde is as the vitall ſpirits, which paſſe through the arteries thereof. And as there happen diuers ſtoppings in the bodie, which hinder the blood, and vitall ſpirits, that they cannot keepe their right courſe and ordinarie paſſage, whereupon their order is troubled, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die pained, in ſuch ſort that grones enſue, and difficultie of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſhakings, and ſuch like accidents: So is it with the bodie of the earth, when any thing happens to it contrarie to the naturall diſpoſition thereof, by the meanes which we haue already heard, whether by water, by fire, by winde and ſuch like. Whereto we will adde alſo this opinion of thoſe, who attribute the cauſe of ſuch motions and tremblings, either to the drineſſe of the earth, which is the occaſion, that it cleaueth and chappeth, and by this meanes giues open way to the aire and to the windes, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate thereinto; or elſe bicauſe of the older age thereof, to which they eſteeme all creatures ſubiect: whereupon it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to it, as to old buildings, which being ruinous and almoſt rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, doe fall downe in ſome places of themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the diuers opinions of men vpon this matter: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if we deſire to take a very ſhort and ſure way to attaine to the true cauſe, wee muſt referre it to the wrath and iudgements of God, bicauſe that what cauſes ſoeuer the learned can inuent, the Eternall ſheweth himſelfe very powerful,<note place="margin">The true cauſe of earthquakes and the profit that wee may reape thereby.</note> and to be feared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, conſidering that he hath diſpoſed all of them, and that they all depend vpon him alone. And ſurely this is a worke of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent woorthie to be woondred at, and which may well cauſe men to mooue and tremble before his maieſtie. For if he ſhewe himſelfe terrible and fearefull by deluges of water, by haile, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

lightning, ſtormes and tempeſts, he doth no leſſe by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſhakings of the earth, which are in regarde thereof, as thunders are in the aire. For ſeeing that the earth is as the foot of the world, and that it is aſſigned to men for their habitation, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it that they may haue recourſe, if it quake vnder them, and faile to ſuſtaine them? Whither ſhall they retire, if ſhe will allow them no more dwelling in hir: but will ſpue them out as the ſcripture ſaith? For if it be hard for them to flie before fire,<note place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE holy Scripture doth certifie vs, how that in the beginning the earth was couered ouer with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that it appeered not in any ſort, but onely vnder the forme of a great deepe, till ſuch time as God commaunded the waters to retire into the channels and places, which hee had prepared for their aboade. So that then the earth was diſcouered, euen ſo much therof, as was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the habitation and nouriſhment of men and beaſts. But this ſoueraigne creator of the Vniuers would not haue the waters to be gathered all into one place, and not to haue their courſe through the earth: but prouiding for euerie commoditie for his creatures, he ordained, that out of the great Ocean ſea, which is as the great bodie of the waters, there ſhould iſſue diuers armes and members, by meanes whereof we haue the Mediterran ſeas: out of which againe proceed many other waters, as lakes, flouds, riuers and brookes. For although that all theſe waters ſeeme to haue their Springing out of certaine fountaines, which many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to be made of the aire; yet the verie truth is, that their chiefe ſource is out of the ſea: which (as it is named in <hi>Iob</hi>) is as the wombe, out of which all waters, both celeſtiall and terreſtriall haue their firſt originall, and do engender &amp; repaire themſelues continually by the meanes that we haue alreadie heard.<note place="margin">Why the water is mixed with the earth.</note> Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the Philoſophers, all reaſon teacheth vs, that this ordinance in nature concerning the diſtribution of the waters throughout the earth, hath beene made of neceſſitie for the mutuall maintenance of theſe two elements: for ſo much as the Earth being naturally drie, cannot ſubſiſt without moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture:
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:8737:140"/>
and contrariwiſe the flowing water, could not haue ought to ſtay vpon, without being propped vp by the earth. Wherfore it was neceſſarie, that the earth ſhould giue it place, and that it ſhould open all her vaines and conduicts, that the water might paſſe through the ſame, both within &amp; vpon it, yea and to pierce euen to the higheſt mountaine tops: in which place being preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the waight of the earth, and alſo in ſome place mooued by the aire, which driueth it, one ſhall ſee it iſſue out in great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie euen as if it were ſquirted out.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoeuer then will conſider of the whole circuit of the earth, ſhall learne that the moitie of the roundnes thereof is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed by the ſea, which floweth round about it, cauſing the waues thereof to goe and come continually, ſometimes aloft, and ſometimes verie low: like as if this terrene globe were a bowle caſt into the water, one part whereof ſhould lye diſcouered out of it,<note place="margin">That the water is round.</note> and the other couered within it: Which water the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers hold to be entirely round, hauing the open heauen in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part ouer it. And this is confirmed by thoſe drops of water which fall vpon the ground, or vpon leaues of trees and of herbs, which are round. If alſo one fill a veſſell top-brim-full of water, they may euidently behold, that the water riſeth and ſwelleth in the middeſt, making a kinde of round forme. In truth, by reaſon that the water is ſubtile and ſoft, theſe things are far better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by arguments and concluding reaſons, wherewith the bookes of the learned are repleniſhed, then by the view of the eie. Notwithſtanding this is verie admirable, that if one put neuer ſo little water into a veſſell alreadie brimme-full, the vppermoſt part thereof will ſhedde ouer: and yet if one caſt into the ſame ſo top-full veſſell, ſome heauy thing, yea to the waight of twenty pence, the water will not ſpill therefore, but will ſwell onely, till ſuch time as it ſtand much aboue the brimme of the veſſell, by the riſing thereof. Moreouer the roundeneſſe of the water, which cauſeth this, doth alſo make that thoſe which are in the top of a ſhip, do ſooner diſcouer land, then thoſe which are in the foredeck, or in the ſterne thereof: ſo likewiſe, if any ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thing bee faſtned to the top of the maſt at parting from the port, it ſeemeth that the veſſell ſtill goeth downewards, till at length the ſight of hir will be cleane loſt. Moreouer how ſhould it bee poſſible that the ocean ſea, which enuironeth the earth, as being the mother-ſea, and the receptacle of all the reſt, doth not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:8737:140"/>
run abroad, conſidering there is no banck to with-hold it, if it were not of round forme? Wherein this is to bee noted, that the water of the ſea doth in no ſort ouerpaſſe the limits thereof, nor doth euer runne but toward the place of the naturall ſcituation thereof.<note place="margin">Why the water doth retaine it ſelfe in it ſelfe, without running abroade.</note> Of which the Greeke Philoſophers haue rendred an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall reaſon by Geometricall propoſitions and concluſions: making demonſtration, that this water cannot run otherwiſe, what roome or ſcope ſoeuer it haue. For they ſay, that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the nature of water is to fall alwaies downeward; and that alſo the ſea ſtretcheth it ſelfe out, ſo far as it can; neuertheleſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the declining of the ſea can ſuffer, as euery one may ſee with his eie: and by how much the lower it is, by ſo much the more it doth approch to the center of the earth: whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, that all lynes drawne from that center to the waters nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to it, are ſhorter then thoſe lines, which are drawne from the vppermoſt waters to the extremity of the ſea: ſo that by that meanes, the water of the ſea doth alwaies decline towards the center, from whence it can in no ſort fall, but doth there retaine it ſelfe.</p>

Wherein we are moreouer to note, that the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh concerning the ſea, in this fore-alledged text of <hi>Iob,</hi> and in many other places of ſcripture, as if it had ſome ſenſe and vnderſtanding, and that God had cauſed it to heare his voice, and had commanded it, as he commandeth men, to obey his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, although it be a ſenſeleſſe creature and without life; but this is to the end that we may better learne to acknowledge the

power &amp; prouidence of God ouer all his works. For the ſea is not onely deafe and depriued of all ſenſe, and much more without vnderſtanding, but alſo exceeding furious and outragious, being mooued by force of windes and tempeſts, in ſuch ſort that it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeemeth, as if it would ouerrun and ſwallow vp all the earth with the waues thereof, and would riſe with the flouds thereof and mount vp to heauen. For one may behold how at one time the waues will ſwell and riſe vp like high mountaines: and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after, wil tumble &amp; couch downe like vallies, &amp; as if the ſea would cleaue and diuide it ſelfe, and ſo diſcouer the deepe bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome thereof.<note place="margin">

But yet wee muſt heere conſider the obedience that the ſea ſheweth, euen in the greateſt furies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to the commandement which God hath deliuered to it from the firſt creation thereof. For although it be often mooued, as we ſaid; yet doth it containe it ſelfe ſhut vp within the boundes, which were appointed vnto it by the ordinance of God, as if it were afraide to run out, and durſt not paſſe farther, as hauing heard and vnderſtood that which the creator thereof had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and had engrauen it in memorie for euer. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſee, that after it hath ſwollen &amp; riſen aloft in waues, and that it hath menaced the earth, as if it would ouerflowe it, and couer it againe with the deepe, as at the beginning: it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthles arreſted, and beaten backe to returne into the proper gulfes thereof, which are aſſigned for it to lodge in, euen by a very little ſand onely.

And yet the word of God, which hath giuen commandement to the ſea (which is ſo horrible and fearefull a creature being mooued) is of ſuch power; that this ſmall ſand is ſufficient to make it keepe within the confines and limits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to breake the furious waues thereof, as if he, who hath eſtabliſhed this ordinance in nature, ſtood in preſence vpon the ſhore ſide, to command it to doe ſo, and that for feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

                  <p>IF wee do not refer all things to the heauenly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of him, who hath framed and compaſſed all with his hand, and doth gouerne all by his prudence and ſuſtaineth all with his power: it will be very difficult, yea impoſſible for vs, to declare the cauſes and reaſons of his works in an humane diſcourſe, which are of ſuch authority, that they may put a good ſpirit out of all ſcruple and doubt: Yea euen in the ſubiect which wee intend now to entreat of; to wit, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ebbing of the ſea. The ſearching out of which ſecret did ſo trouble a certaine great Philoſopher (ſome ſay, <hi>Aristotle</hi>) that beeing vpon the ſhore of Euboea now called Negropont, onely to ſearch out and to behold the naturall cauſe thereof, and not beeing able to enforme himſelfe ſufficiently therein, it did ſo vex him, that chafing at nature himſelfe, and againſt the water, he caſt himſelfe into the ſea, ſaying to it (ſith I cannot comprehend thee,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:8737:142"/>
yet ſhalt thou haue the honor to comprehend mee, and keepe mee within thy gulfs) and indeed he was heere ſwallowed by the deepe. And certes this ordinary ebbing and flowing of the ocean, according to which it goeth, commeth, ſpreadeth it ſelfe abroade, and then doth euery day retire, without euer fayling in the order thereof, muſt needes be a moſt wonderfull thing. And that which is moſt admirable therein is, that the flowing and eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing thereof doe follow the courſe of the moone.<note place="margin">Of the ebbing and flowing of the ſea.</note> To which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net likewiſe is attributed with moſt apparant reaſon the cauſe of this flowing and ebbing; ſhe beeing as the regent of the ſeas and waters, by the appointment of the ſoueraigne creator, as is ſeene by experience and by the agreeablenes of nature, which they haue togither. For wee muſt note, that as the moone encreaſeth or waineth, ſo is it with the ſtate of the flowing of the ſea: And therefore although that it happen diuerſly, yet the principall cauſe of the motion thereof reſideth in his planet. For betweene the two times that ſhe riſeth, which is in fower and twenty how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wherein ſhe compaſſeth the whole earth, the ſea doth twiſe flow, &amp; doth as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times ebbe. And when the moone beginneth to mount in the eaſt, then doth the floud riſe, and the ſea ſwell, till ſuch time as this planet doth attaine to our right meridian, which is in the mid-heauen, and that it begin to decline towardes the weſt: at which time the water ebbeth. Yet neuertheles all thoſe ſix howers, wherein the moone maketh hir courſe towards the line of mid-night oppoſite to our noone-line, the floud retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and increaſeth, till after it hath paſſed that line; and then it doth ebbe againe, till ſuch time as the ſaid regent thereof the moone returne againe aboue our horizon. It is moſt certaine that the floud doth neuer returne iuſt at that very hower and inſtant, wherein it flowed the day before. But this doth proceede like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from the courſe of the moone, which ſeruing for theſe baſe and inferiour things, and not riſing euery day at one ſelfeſame inſtant, ſhe doth draw the courſe of the ſea with hir: in ſuch ſort, that the tide is more late, and of ſhorter continuance at one time then at another, and yet doth not the diſtance of time betweene the tides change one whit, for it endureth ſix howers in ebbe, and ſo long time in flowing. But here we meane not all manner of howers, as our common howers are, according to the different ſituation of places, but we meane equall and equinoctial howers, by conſideration whereof the ebbing and flowing of the ſea will
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:8737:142"/>
be found alwaies of like time, as is aboueſaide. Moreouer from ſeuen daies to ſeuen daies, the flowing is found different by the ſame power of the moone: for it is but very ſmall the firſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof, and till it be halfe round. In the ſecond quarter it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies encreaſeth till full-moone: at which time the ſea is at hir greateſt height. From thence forward the floud decreaſeth: ſo that the third quarter it is in the ſame ſtate wherein it was the firſt quarter. Neuertheleſſe when the waining moone is halfe round, the floud beginneth to riſe. But when ſhe is in coniunction with the ſunne, the tide riſeth as high as at full moone. And when the moone is high and ſeptentrionall, the tide is not ſo vehement as when ſhe is meridionall, bicauſe that being then more neere to the earth, ſhe doth the more exerciſe hir power.</p>
                  <p>But many haue indeuoured in this matter to vnderſtand,<note place="margin">Why the ocean doth differ in flowing from other ſeas.</note> why the flowings of the Ocean ſea doe reach farther, then thoſe of the other Mediterranean ſeas, wherein the ebbings and flowings doe not appeere as in the Ocean. Which may be ſaid to proceed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that a thing which is entire hath more power, then any part which is ſeparated. Alſo the high ſea retayneth in it ſelfe more of the power of the Moone, which worketh vpon it at eaſe and pleaſure, beyond all compariſon more forcibly then vpon other ſeas which are narrower, and miniſter leſſe meanes to this planet to exerciſe her rule therein. From whence it commeth to paſſe, that lakes and riuers do neuer flow. And for the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean ſeas they are encloſed about with the earth, as in an hauen, though there bee ſome places, or ſome armes of the ſame ſeas verie broad. Some likewiſe are verie much ſubiect to the Moone, as the Adriaticke gulfe, wherein Venice is builded, which ebbeth and floweth twiſe euerie day like the Ocean. And it is to bee noted, that ſuch motions are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceiued on the ſhore and ſea-coaſts, then in the midſt thereof: euen as the pulſe of the arteries is better knowne in the extremes of the bodie, then in the bulk thereof.<note place="margin">Other cauſes of the flowing and ebbing of the ſea.</note> Some alſo do render this cauſe of the flowing, and ebbing of the ſea, to wit, that though the waters thereof be ſalt, yet were not this ſufficient for their conſeruation, no more then of their neighbor the aire, if they had not a continuall motion. For we ſee, that ſea-water doth preſently corrupt beeing in a veſſel, and not mooued. Many alſo haue noted that in euery reuolution or courſe of the moone, the tyde reſteth for three daies long, to wit, the 7. 8. and 9. day there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:8737:143"/>
and that when ſhee is at full, all ſeas do purge themſelues by ſcummes. Certainely it is woondrous to ſee what power this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net hath, not onely ouer the waters, but alſo ouer the earth, and ouer all liuing creatures.<note place="margin">Of the power of the moone ouer all creatures.</note> Which hath miniſtred occaſion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Philoſophers to ſuppoſe, that the moone was that quickning-ſpirit, which nouriſheth the earth; and that alſo by hir inconſtant courſe approching diuers waies to the inferior bodies, ſhee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced diuers effects, ſometimes repleniſhing them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leauing them void &amp; empty. Whereof it commeth, that all fiſhes hauing ſcales and ſhels, do encreaſe and decreaſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe of the moone: and that all liuing creatures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which haue bloud, do feele themſelues refreſhed, when ſhee renueth. It is likewiſe ſuppoſed, that the bloud augmenteth or diminiſheth in man, according as the moone encreaſeth, or wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: yea that herbes and trees do partake of hir power. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> alſo doth note, that thoſe creatures which are readie to die, do die onely when the ſea ebbeth. But in this matter, as in all things which do concerne the ebbing and flowing of the Ocean, wee muſt euer haue recourſe to the ordinance that the Eternall father of the vniuers hath eſtabliſhed in all his creatures: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which they perſeuer in obedience to their creator, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tranſgreſſing one title of his lawes: as wee haue a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the ſea, and in the waters, which containe themſelues in ſuch admirable ſort (as in our former ſpeech is declared) within their bounds and limits.<note place="margin">A maruailous inundation of waters in the yeere 1530.</note> And if at any time they ouerflowe (as whilome happened in Holland, where the water brake through the dams and banks, wherewith the countrie is bounded; ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vp the coaſt-townes, with an incredible loſſe of men and riches: as alſo at the ſame time Tiber did ſo ouerflowe at Rome, that it roſe in the fields the height of a lance, ruinating in fower and twenty howers many bridges and ſtately edifices, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dommagement whereof, compriſing therein the mooueable goodes loſt, was eſteemed to amount to the value of three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of golde: there being aboue three thouſand perſons choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and drowned.)

And ſo he himſelfe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:8737:143"/>
hath propheſied vnto vs, ſaying:<note place="margin">

Surely when we ſee them riſe and ſtand vp againſt men, to worke them euill in ſtead of doing them good, contrarie to the end of their firſt creation; we muſt conſider of them, as if they enuied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to ſerue men any more, which turne diſloyall, ingratefull, and peruerſe towards him, from whom their totall good procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: As the ſunne did witnes when it waxed darke at the death of our Redeemer, depriuing thoſe of his light, which were riſen vp againſt the eternal Sonne of God, that had created them.

And which day being neere, it is no maruell, if God doe daily ſhew his particular iudgements vpon men, to put them in minde of this generall and vniuerſall iudgement, whereto heauen, earth, the ſea, and all creatures ſhall come togither: and therefore alſo he giueth them ſo many ſignes of his wrath, by thunders, tempeſts, deluges, and inundations of water, as we haue made mention.

                  <p>ACcording to the nature of the moſt woonderfull workes of God, in all that, which he hath created, the maruels are innumerable, which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:8737:144"/>
in the ſea, and in all the waters which proceede out of it, and returne into it, without any increaſing or diminiſhing in it ſelfe, as we haue already heard. And if there were no other thing, but that the waters of the ſea are alwaies ſalt, and other waters are for the moſt part freſh, would not that be ſufficient to teach vs to acknowledge the great power, wiſedome, and bountie of the creator, and how puiſſant he is in all his workes? For though that all waters are of one nature, as making vp one onely ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet doth he make them of diuers qualities, according as he knoweth how to purifie, diſtill and purge, or elſe to mingle and mix them,<note place="margin">Of the diuers qualities of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the prouidence of God therein.</note> with his other creatures. Whereupon it falleth out, that wee haue not onely ſalt waters in the ſea, but that there are ſome found alſo in fountaines, yea oftentimes very neere to other ſprings of freſh water: Wherein the prouidence of God declareth it ſelfe to bee verie great. For if all waters were ſalt; men and beaſts could not liue, nor the earth fructifie, and nouriſh the fruits thereof: becauſe that liuing creatures cannot want freſh water, whether it be for their drinke, or for their other neceſſary commodities: neither is ſalt water fit to water the earth, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that ſalt makes it barren. On the other ſide, if all waters were freſh, where might men finde ſalt enough to ſuffice them, for the neceſſarie commodities of their life? For although that there bee ſome ſalt-mines, and ſome ſalt-ground, as appeareth by the ſalt waters of fountaines, which paſſe through ſuch grounds: yet the beſt meanes to haue good ſalt and in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, is by the waters, and chiefly by ſea water. What may we ſay alſo of ſo many ſorts of water, whereof ſome participate with Sulphure; ſome with allom; others with iron or braſſe, or with other mettals or minerals, which do heat ſome of them in ſuch ſort, as men make naturall bathes of them, hauing diuers ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and powers, which ſerue for medicines in many kindes of diſeaſes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Why the ſea-water is ſalt.</note>Now the Philoſophers doe much ſtraine themſelues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the cauſes of ſo many maruellous effects. For ſome ſay that the ſunne, which is the greateſt of all planets, drying vp by his heat the moiſture of the water, and burning and ſucking vp all the humiditie of the earth, doth by this decoction cauſe the ſea to become ſalt, becauſe the force of the ſolarie fire doth attract vnto it the moſt freſh and ſubtile part of the water, making the more heauie and thicke part that remaineth, to be ſalter and of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8737:144"/>
more ſubſtance: whereof it commeth, that the water towards the ſea bottome is freſher, then that which is aboue. Others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage three efficients, which both cauſe and continue the ſaltnes: to wit, the heat of the ſunne, for the foreſaid reaſons; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it maketh the water to putrifie: then the continuall agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof by flowing and ebbing, which cauſeth that the ſea neither reſteth nor runneth a direct courſe: and thirdly the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie receiuing of raine. For they ſay, that when ſalt reſteth in the water, it deſcendeth downewards by reaſon of the waight thereof: and when the water runneth, it is purified by the earth: and that all raine-water, becauſe it is heated by the ſunne, and doth putrifie through tardation and ſlownes, is ſomewhat brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh. But they are much more troubled when they entreat of fountaines. For ſome ſay, that the ſea yeeldeth none but ſalt-waters, as is ſeene by many waters neere it: And that thoſe which are freſh, become ſo by a long and vehement courſe. Others maintaine that they be engendred by the aire. Now experience manifeſteth, that their ſaltnes is diminiſhed by the length and continuance of the courſe of the water. For the farther that wels are from the ſea, the more freſh they are: becauſe the water doth more purge it ſelfe, by the earth ouer which it trauerſeth, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a part of the force thereof, and ſometimes all of it, in the ſlime, and in the ſand. And here we may note, that waters,<note place="margin">Of fountaines and wels, and why the water of them ſeemeth hotter in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially well waters, which doe all come from ſome ſprings, doe ſeeme to be hotter in winter then in ſommer, although they doe neuer chaunge their nature: for this proceedeth of the aire, which is cold in winter and hot in ſommer. Through the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then of theſe things one ſelfe ſame water ſeemeth to receiue diuers qualities: euen as we ſee, that according to the diſpoſition of our bodie, the qualitie of the aire, which enuironeth vs, is eſteemed. For when we are hot, we do ſuppoſe that which we touch to be cold: and when we be cold, we eſteeme that which we touch to be otherwiſe. Wherefore we muſt iudge euen ſo of the inner parts of the earth, eſteeming them to be ſimply nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hotter nor colder in one ſeaſon more then in another, but onely in reſpect of the aire. Indeed water doth waxe a little warme, when through the coldnes of the aire, the heat is conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to retire it ſelfe downeward in ſuch ſort as it cannot iſſue nor ſpred it ſelfe vpon the earth: and therefore the ſnow which doth not ly long vpon it, doth commonly make it more fertile;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:8737:145"/>
for it retayneth the heat in the bowels thereof. Moreouer, the vppermoſt part of the earth, which the water may come to, is of a clammie ſlime of the nature of brimſtone or of ſalt, or of mettall: which alſo cauſeth that the exhalations encloſed in this part doe heat the water. And therefore ſuch waters are either odoriferous, or of a bad ſmell, or without any ſauour, of which qualities one may eaſily iudge by the ſmell and taſte. For ſome waters ſauour not onely of lime, or of ſalt; but they doe alſo boile, as in the bathes neere to Padua;<note place="margin">Why ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do boile.</note> yea ſuch waters are verie ordinarie, ſo that there are few regions, but haue ſome of them. But they are moſt common in Germanie and in Italy. And the cauſe that they ſo boyle is, either fire or putrefaction, or elſe naturall or celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all heat. But for the celeſtiall heat, it ſeemeth that it cannot be ſo great, eſpecially in winter and in the night time, that it ſhould heat the water verie much. And for naturall heat, it is neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall but in liuing creatures, becauſe they haue life and ſenſe. Neither is putrified heat ſo powerfull, that it can make water to boile; neither is it verie likely, that the ſubſtance of any thing may be engendred and corrupted at one inſtant. It reſteth then, that the cauſe ſhould rather be in the fire; conſidering alſo, that heat hath but little motion, except it attaine to the height there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereas otherwiſe it doth quench it ſelfe. And therefore it is that matter which burneth vnder the earth, that miniſtreth this puiſſant heat, which doth ſo warme the water. And wee may moreouer note, that all thoſe waters which boyle ſo, are naturally light, and haue ſome medicinable facultie and propertie: And yet they are not to be ſo much accounted of, as that which is fit for common vſage in mens affaires to preſerue health.<note place="margin">What water is beſt.</note> For good water hath neither colour, ſmel, nor ſauour, and is paſſing cleere; and being drunke it abideth not long in the belly: ſuch (they ſay) is the water of the riuer Euleus, which falleth from the mountaine Zager by Suſiana, whereof the kings of Perſia did make prouiſion in their expeditions and warlike voyages. For to the preſeruation of health, water is no leſſe to bee carefully choſen,<note place="margin">Diuers cauſes of cold waters, and their taſts, colours, and ſmelles.</note> then aire. Now as warme waters are famous for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons heretofore deliuered; ſo there are ſome waters alſo verie much admired for their great coldnes, whereof ſnowe, marble, mettals, cold aire, ſudden motion, and the great fall from aloft, (euerie one in his degree) may be the cauſe. Againe, the ſauours or taſtes of waters are verie diuers, and the principal cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:8737:145"/>
is heat. For ſodden earth (which is of ſundry ſorts) giueth a taſt to water, according to the quality thereof. And the like reaſon is concerning colours; for fine &amp; thin clay doth cauſe the colour of waters: but thick clay tarrieth not in water, and therefore dieth it not. The ſame cauſe is alſo in the difference of ſmels. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies waters that are of a good ſmel, are profitable for creatures: but ſtinking waters cauſe diſeaſes: for (as Philoſophers ſay) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie cauſes appertaine to contrarie things. Good water like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is lighteſt, as that which fleeteth aboue other water, be it in riuers, ſprings, or wels. From whence it commeth that freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter floateth vpon ſea water: which likewiſe being more maſſiue and waightie, beareth more heauie burdens. And amongſt freſh waters, the water of Rhodanus or Roſne (in France) ſwimmeth vpon that of the lake of Geneua, paſſing ouer the midſt thereof. Alſo many rare properties and great woonders are written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning waters, with the cauſes of them: as that,<note place="margin">Of a floud which ran not on the ſabboth day.</note> which is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> of a certaine floud in Iudea neere Syria, which ranne euery day, except vpon the Sabbaoth day: which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a matter religious, and as a myracle: although that this might happen and come to paſſe through a naturall cauſe, if we will ſo argue, to wit, that no more water was gathered into this floud by orderly ſpaces, then was ſufficient to runne for ſixe daies and not for the ſeuenth: in ſuch ſort as Phiſitions render a like cauſe concerning the renewings or fits, and ceaſings of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. For the world is the great man, as man is the little worlde. But not ſtretching this diſcourſe any farther, we will onelie note for concluſion thereof, that in the diuerſitie of the kindes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that which is gathered togither in one place &amp; is ſalt,<note place="margin">Of the diuers appellations of waters.</note> is called the ſea; the freſh water ſo gathered togither is called a lake; &amp; if it mooue not at all, it is named a mariſh or fen: but if it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what deepe, it is a ſtanding poole; and if it runne, then is it a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: if it gather through raines, or by ſnowe, then is it a torrent, or raine-floud: and if it ſpring, it is a fountaine; which is euer the beſt water, and doth ſlowlieſt putrifie. For it is leaſt moiſt, and is moſt concocted by the heauenly heate. Alſo the lighteſt water doth hardlieſt corrupt: for which cauſe it is moſt fit for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of mans life, as approching neereſt to the ſubſtance of the aire, by which we breath. We haue ſaid enough then concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter. But me thinketh that our ſucceeding diſcourſe requireth that we ſhould entreate of thoſe commodities, which

For it is to be noted, that euery land and countrey ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be furniſhed with al commodities, bicauſe God hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed therof, that ſome abound in thoſe things which otherſome do greatly want &amp; ſtand in need of. But by meanes of ſayling by water, all that which can be required may be tranſported from one countrey to another, with very ſmall trouble &amp; charges: ſo that one nation may communicate thoſe commodities with another, which the creator hath particularly beſtowed on them all, each granting mutuall helpe to the other by this meanes. Wherin ſurely we may acknowledge the prouidence of God to be verie great &amp; manifold.<note place="margin">Of the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in diſtribution of his gifts.</note> For firſt the Lord hath diſpoſed of his creatures, and diſtributed his treaſures according to the diuerſity of landes and countries, euen in ſuch manner as he diuideth his gifts and graces amongſt men. For he beſtoweth not all either vpon one or vpon two, or vpon three, or vpon any other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number of them: And therefore there neuer hath beene, nor ſhall be any one, which either could or may ſurpaſſe all others ſo much, that hee may haue no need of another, or that hath ſufficient for himſelfe. For if one man poſſeſſed all, he would thinke himſelfe to be no more a man, but a God rather, and would therefore contemne all others. Moreouer it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that if euery one were ſo well furniſhed with all things, that they might all ſurpaſſe one another, there would be no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſocietie. For one would make no account of another: but being all puffed vp with pride (whereto they are naturally encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) there woulde ariſe a thouſand quarrels and diſſenſions
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:8737:146"/>
amongſt them, as wee ordinarily ſee to happen amongſt the proud, mightie, puiſſant and rich. For ſeeing that charitie, which ſhould dwell amongſt men, can take no place; how could they be vnited and allied togither in amitie, if they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained therto through neceſſitie? and if it be a difficult matter to conioine and maintaine them in peace and mutuall good will, what neede ſoeuer they haue one of another, one may eaſilie iudge what woulde enſue, if they had not neceſſitie for their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe to this effect, which cauſeth them to do in ſpight of al their abilities, that which ſhe cannot obtaine of them, but by force. Againe how could men exerciſe the workes of charitie amongſt themſelues, (which workes are very much commended vnto them by God, to be done towards their neighbors) if euery one could at his pleaſure excell his companion? As then God hath placed and diſpoſed ſundry members in one bodie, and yet hath not appointed them one ſelfe-ſame office, but to euery one his owne: ſo hath it pleaſed him to diuide and diſtribute his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, gifts, and graces amongſt men, to the end that they may one ſerue another, as members of one and the ſame bodie, which can not conſiſt without the reciprocall helpe of all. So likewiſe hath he eſtabliſhed the ſundrie regions of the earth, enriching euerie one of them with certaine particular commodities, which do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conſtraine men to helpe and ſuccour one another, and to liue in peace: without which, they woulde like madde beaſts ouer-runne and deſtroy each other, as we (wretches) doe finde true, eſpecially in time of warre. But wee may well note vpon this point, that although the moſt mightie do by their hate, enimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſſenſions, reuengements and warres, contend oftentimes with all their power, to ſtop and hinder the trafficke, dealings, and tranſportations of merchandize from one countrey, and out of one place to another, eſpecially of foode and victuals; yet whatſoeuer they may or can doe (bee they kings, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Emperors) they cannot for all that make ſuch a ſtoppe,<note place="margin">That nothing can ſtop the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of men.</note> but that they will alwaies paſſe and ſcape by ſome meanes, maugre all their powers. Wherein wee muſt acknowledge, that ſeeing God hath ordained, that thoſe which beare his image, ſhoulde haue communication one with another, for the cauſes aforeſaide, and that chiefly by the aide of nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is a great preſumption in mighty men to oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the order of the Omnipotent, and againſt that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:8737:147"/>
communion of benefits, which hee will haue to bee maintained amongſt men. Whom he can conſtraine to obſerue his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, euen through their owne couetouſnes, when their charitie faileth, making them to deſpiſe all dangers, that they may ſupply where neede is, though they be forbidden vpon paine of death. For ſuch reſtraint by commandement is ſo farre from hindring their couetouſnes, that it doth more inflame it, bicauſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect greater gaine, then if there were mutual libertie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cauſe more ware ſecretly to paſſe, and by that meanes they put all to hazard: yea they would rather open a way vnder ground (like moles) or elſe would flie in the aire (like birds) then leaue ſuch trading: ſo woonderfull is God in all his works, and in the gouernment of all nature. For when he pleaſeth, he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his owne turne with the affections and euill works of men, yea drawing good out of their euill, euen againſt their owne wils. And therefore we may very well affirme, that ſeeing God will haue men trafficke togither; it cannot chooſe, howſoeuer they enterpriſe to the contrarie, but that this order muſt be continued. For this cauſe likewiſe it was not the will of the creator, that the waters ſhould ſo gather themſelues into one place, that they might not run through the earth: but hee ordained, that out of the great Ocean (which is like the great bodie of the waters, and like the wombe, out of which they doe all firſt ſpring, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are engendred, and whereby they are repaired for euer) there ſhould iſſue diuers armes and members, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee haue the Mediterranean ſeas, lakes, floods, riuers and brookes. So alſo in this diſtribution, and by the meanes of naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, God hath giuen vs many other meanes; to the ende we might behold with our eies, many teſtimonies of his prouidence engrauen in euery part of the vniuers, by the diſpoſition of the works of his almightie hand, as they who ſaile vpon the waters are conſtrained to acknowledge.<note place="margin">Of the direction that marriners haue by the ſtars.</note> For as he hath appointed the watrie element, to ſerue men to nauigate therin; ſo hath he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ordained the ſtars enchaſed therin, to direct them in the midſt of the great gulfs &amp; deeps of the ſea. For when the ſhips are entred very farre into it, they that be therein doe cleane loſe the ſight of lande; ſo that they cannot iudge by the conſideration thereof, in what place they are, nor vpon what ſide, neither to what place they may bend their courſe to finde a conuenient port, but they muſt take their directions from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:8737:147"/>And for this cauſe alſo, though that the heauen be in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall motion, and that all the planets and ſtarres doe follow it, riſing and ſetting in ſuch ſort, as they doe not alwaies appeere to men: yet there are ſome of another condition. For neere to the place, which Aſtronomers take for the pole, there are certaine ſtarres which haue their motion and courſe ſo diſpoſed, that they are alwaies ſeene at ſea, being neuer hidden like the reſt: and among theſe that is one, which is called the Pole-ſtarre, which is neuer ſeene to remooue (except a very little) out of one place: ſo that it ſeemeth the whole heauen turneth about this ſtarre: As we alſo maintaine, that it hath the like place correſpondent thereto directly ouer againſt it in the other part of heauen, with a like appellation of name (as we haue heretofore declared in our diſcourſes concerning the celeſtiall bodies) excepting the difference, which is put betweene theſe two poles, taken from their oppoſite ſituation in heauen, and from the ſtarres, which are next vnto them; which alſo haue their courſe and motion like the reſt: but doe onely differ in this, that riſing and ſetting are not attributed vnto them, bicauſe they may be alwaies ſeen, when the ſpheres are diſcerned. For when the skie is couered with clouds, marriners doe finde themſelues very much hindred and troubled. For then they prooue that which <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the workes of God, to wit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.</note> that hee commandeth the ſunne, and it riſeth not, and he cloſeth vp the ſtarres, as vnder a ſignet. And that he maketh the ſtarre Arcturus, Orion, and Plei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades, and the Climates of the ſouth, doing great things and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, yea maruellous things without number. Whereupon we may note, that here is eſpeciall mention made of the ſepten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trionall ſtarres, as well bicauſe that they are more ſeene then the reſt, as alſo bicauſe it is their propertie to bring and to procure raine and tempeſts (if we may credite Aſtrologers) which cauſe that the heauen cannot be ſeene.<note place="margin">Of Charles hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeede ſome haue called them the Beare, ſeeing them ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioined togither, taking the foure quarters apart as if they were the fower quarters of a Beare, and the other three as the taile
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:8737:148"/>
thereof. There are ſome alſo, who haue named them the Dragon or Serpent, bicauſe that being conſidered togither they might ſeeme to repreſent ſome ſuch forme. But howſoeuer, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that pilots of gallies and ſhips doe direct and guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues chiefly by theſe northren ſtarres, as being moſt ſeene, and beſt knowne by men, and bicauſe they doe almoſt alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in one place, like the pole, or elſe doe mooue ſo little, that they are neuer out of ſight, eſpecially that conſtellation which is properly deſigned by name of the Beare, &amp; is called the greater Beare in compariſon of a leſſe called the leſſer Beare. And for which cauſe alſo the pole, which is in this region and part of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is called Arcticke, which is to ſay, of the Beare: for (Arctos) in Greeke ſignifieth a Beare. Now hereby we farther learne, that it is very requiſite for marriners, and chiefly for maſters and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors of gallies and ſhips, to be Aſtronomers, at leaſtwiſe ſo much as to know the foreſaid ſtarres, and to know how to iudge of the eleuation of the pole, and of the degrees, and the diſtances of euery land and countrie, according to the eleuation. For it is by it, that not onely marriners, but Geometricians and Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers alſo doe take their meaſures, and dimenſions to part and meaſure out the earth. But wee haue ſtaied long ynough in this matter, now we will conſider how God hath diuided and limited out this terreſtriall globe, and the ſundry countries and regions that are therein, by the ſea and ſeparation of the water: as (ASER) you can diſcourſe vnto vs.</p>

                     <hi>STrabo</hi> a man as well ſeene in good letters as anie other that hath written of Geographie, ſaith; That the earth is enuironed about by the Ocean: and therfore he parteth it into foure very great gulfes:<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the Ocean into fowre gulfes.</note> the firſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of turneth towards the north, &amp; is called the Caſpian or Hircani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſea: the ſecond and third is that of Arabia, and the gulfe of Ormuz or the Perſian ſea, turning towards the ſouth: and the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:8737:148"/>
fourth being greateſt of all the reſt is that whereinto the Ocean entreth at the ſtreight of Gibraltar, which ſome call the pillers of <hi>Hercules;</hi> which gulfe is called by the name of the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran or Middle-earth-ſea, bicauſe it is compaſſed round about with land. And the ſame Mediterran ſea runneth, enlarging it ſelfe, &amp; making many bayes &amp; gulfs, ſomtimes waſhing the coaſt of Europe, and ſometimes that of Africa, and ſo it extendeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eaſt, and receiueth diuers names according to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces through which it paſſeth. For the firſt coaſt by which it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth is called Mauritania Tingitana, which is that of Tremiſſen;<note place="margin">Of the mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean ſeas.</note> then doth it take the name of Mauritania Caeſarienſis, towards Algier, and Tunis; then is it named the Africke-ſea towards Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly in Barbarie; then paſſing the quicke ſandes it is the Lybian ſea; and entring vpon the Marmarica and Cyrenaica, it gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with that name till it water Egypt, and then it is ſaide to be the Egyptian ſea. And all this coaſt is from the eaſt to the weſt, till you arriue at the gulfe of Lariſſa beyond Damiata, and at the vttermoſt of the deſarts of the ſouth-eaſt, where Aſia and Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca do ſeparate. From which port being in Paleſtina, you muſt turne north and north-eaſt, as if you would take your courſe by the weſt: and then this ſea which was called the Syriack-ſea bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of all Syria to Tripolis, changeth name, and is called the Egean ſea, till you come to Galli-polis, or Heleſpont, making all this way diuers baies and gulfes: and vnder this name it coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth Thracia, and the lands which abutte vpon Macedonia, and Morea, till you come to Albania, and there it beginneth to be called the Adriatick ſea: then doubling towards the ſouth, it floweth by the countrey of Calabria to the towne of Rhegium, vnder the name of the Ionick ſea, and paſſing betweene Sicilie and Italy, in ſtead of the old name Charybdis, it is called the Tyrrhene ſea, and from thence it runneth towards the coaſt of Genoa, by name of the Liguſtick ſea, which diuideth and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth France from Italy, being nominated the French ſea: then to end the courſe, and finiſh the compaſſe, it approcheth the iſles of Maiorca &amp; Minorca, being called the Balearick ſea. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding farther, it runneth to the ſtreight of Barbarie, bearing name the Iberian ſea, where it returneth to the firſt point, from whence we ſaid it firſt parted, to wit, at the ſtreight of Gibraltar, which is the entrance of one ſea into another.</p>
                  <p>Now in this briefe diſcourſe, vpon which Coſmogrophers
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:8737:149"/>
haue written many great volumes, we haue verie goodly matter to conſider vpon, not without much woonder of the prouidence of God; in that it hath pleaſed him to diuide, part, and limit out the earth,<note place="margin">Things to bee conſidered of, by the diuiſion of lands by the waters. <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.</note> and the ſundry countries and nations that are therein, by the ſea, and by the boſomes, gulfes, and armes thereof. For as it is written [God hath made of one bloud all mankinde, to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath aſſigned the times which were ordained before, and the bounds of their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.] Which is as much to ſay, that as men haue not made nor created themſelues, but haue beene created by the Eternall; ſo are they borne where he pleaſeth, hauing aſſigned them a place vpon the earth, not at their choiſe but at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And therefore alſo he eſtabliſheth their habitation, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, according to his good will, either keeping them within the countrey in which they were borne, or elſe driuing them out, and bringing them into ſtrange lands, as we haue verie euident examples throughout all the holy Hiſtorie, where mention is made of the children of Iſrael. For though the Scripture doth deliuer vs no teſtimonie of the prouidence of God ſo ſpeciall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other nations, as it aſſureth vs to haue beene towards the people of Iſrael: yet we muſt neuertheleſſe beleeue, that there is not any one man that dwelleth vpon the earth, to whom the Lord hath not by his prouidence aſſigned the place of his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: But he would giue an example and more certainty in his people, of that which he ordinarily doth towards all nations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee doth it not ſo openly, nor with ſo great fauour and grace, as is declared in thoſe whom he accounteth for his children.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.</note> And therefore the prophet ſaith, [That it is God, who changeth the times and ſeaſons, he taketh away kings, he ſetteth vp kings: bicauſe he giueth and taketh away kingdomes, and he augmenteth, cutteth off, and altereth the limits of them as he pleaſeth.] Whereby we alſo learne, that we muſt not attribute either to the prudence and wiſedome of any one, or yet to the force and power, or to the weapons or armies of men, the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which we daily ſee in the ſtate of the moſt mighty: but to the onely ordinance and diſpoſition of God, by which ſuch alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come to paſſe, according as the ſoueraigne iudge knoweth to bee expedient and iuſt for the chaſtiſement and puniſhing of men by one another, or elſe to ſhew himſelfe benigne and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable towards them. For which cauſe the ſcripture ſaith, that the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8737:149"/>
Lord vſing as his inſtrument <hi>Senacherib</hi> the tyrant of Aſſyria to chaſtiſe many people and nations;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſay</hi> 10.</note> he calleth him the rodde and ſcourge of his wrath: and doth greatly reprehend him by <hi>Iſay,</hi> for that he attributed to himſelfe the glory of thoſe victories which he had giuen him, not bicauſe of his vertues (conſidering he was a fierce and cruell king) but bicauſe God woulde vſe him againſt thoſe who deſerued to be chaſtiſed by the hands of ſuch a tyrant and murtherer. If then we conſider (as behooueth vs) vpon that which we haue here ſummarily touched, we ſhall finde therein excellent doctrine for all kings, princes, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and for all men, as well in generall, as in particular: to the end to induce them,<note place="margin">That euery one muſt containe himſelfe within the limits of his habitation.</note> that they may containe themſelues within the incloſure of thoſe confines wherein God hath placed them. For as he is curſed in the lawe, which paſſeth the bounds of his neighbors poſſeſſion; ſo muſt we not doubt, but that they are ſubiect to the ſame curſe, who cannot containe themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of thoſe countries,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.</note> in which God hath confined them, beſtowing vpon them power, ſignories, and habitation therein. For from whence proceede the greateſt diſſenſions and cruelleſt wars, but from the ambition and auarice of men, which will one vſurpe aboue another, that which appertaineth not vnto them, and by ſuch meanes doe out-paſſe their limits? whereas if euery one would content himſelfe with that part and portion of land, which the creator thereof hath beſtowed vpon him, who doubteth, but that men ſhould liue in much more peace? As then God through his prouidence would conſtraine them by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and neede which they haue one of another, to trafficke and communicate togither in libertie and mutuall ſecuritie, by that meanes to receiue out of one countrie into another thoſe things which faile therein, and abound elſewhere, and for the cauſes by vs heretofore deliuered: ſo it hath pleaſed him to ſet mightie and ſtrong bounds and limits againſt their ambition and auarice, eſpecially of kings, princes, and great men. For we ſee how he hath diuided and ſeparated one countrie from another, and the diuers regions and kingdomes of the earth not onely by meanes of ſeas, lakes, and great riuers, but alſo by craggie, high, and vnpaſſable mountaines, which (as the kingly prophet wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth) he hath eſtabliſhed by his power,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.</note> that by this meanes men might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fined within the bounds of the habitation aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Eternall to euery people, in ſuch ſort as he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:8737:150"/>
the waters within their places, to the courſe which he hath ordained them,<note place="margin">Againſt the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of men.</note> hauing bounded them with hils and rocks. And yet there are no boundes ſo difficult to paſſe, which may bridle and reſtraine the ambition and inſatiable deſire of men within any limits, but that they will paſſe ouer the deepeſt, the longeſt, the ampleſt, and broadeſt waters, and the higheſt and ſteepeſt mountaines in the world: ſo that there are no places ſo inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, through which they will not cut a paſſage, one to ouer-run another by great outrage and violence. Wherein ſurely they euidently declare, that they are much more furious then the ſea, how outragious and rough ſoeuer it bee; ſeeing they can in no wiſe containe themſelues within their limits, as the waters doe: which alſo maketh them more vnreaſonable then brute beaſts. For although there be many vnruly and furious horſes in one ſtable, yet each of them will commonly bee ſtaied with an halter made but of a little coard or leather, and will be kept by a little bar of wood, from ſtriking &amp; running ouer one another, ſo that one onely ſtable will ſerue them all. But men doe to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhew themſelues to be ſuch furious and contentious beaſtes, that the whole world cannot ſuffice them. For there is neither riuer, ſea, lake, nor mountaine, which can be a barre ſufficient to withhold them from forcing and rauaging one another, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues by horrible maſſacres, and cruell warres. Which no doubt commeth vnto them eſpecially through want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging and conſidering vpon the prouidence of God, by which he hath appointed bounds to their habitation, ambition, and auarice, as we haue ſaid, and for that they will not containe themſelues within them, obeying the ordinance of their creator. But we haue ſaid ynough concerning this ſubiect. Let vs now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vpon thoſe commodities which come to men and to all creatures, by the courſe of the waters thorough the earth.

                  <p>IF men doe but ſlenderly acknowledge the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in the limits of their habitation which hee hath appointed, as well by meanes of mountaines as by waters (as we haue heard in the precedent ſpeech:) they doe alſo make but ſmall ſtay in the conſideration of thoſe great commodities, which he giueth and ſendeth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to them by means of them, &amp; of al the earth. For as he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth this fruitfull mother by dew &amp; raine from heauen, as hath beene heretofore expreſſed: ſo doth he moiſten it by meanes of fountaines, floods and riuers, which doe run through it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we muſt note, that the life of all corporall creatures doth principally conſiſt in heate, and that this heate cannot be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and maintained without moiſture, whereby it is nouriſhed: euen as the flame of the ſnuffe, or match of a candle or lampe is nouriſhed and maintained by the fat and humor which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Therefore as God hath placed the ſunne in heauen like a great fountaine of heate, and a great furnace of fire for to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed and diſpoſed into all partes of the world: ſo hath hee eſtabliſhed the ſea here belowe in the earth, as a great and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall fountaine conuenient for the nouriſhment and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of this heate, which is communicated to the earth, and to all the creatures that are therein. And therefore alſo this ſea ſpreadeth it ſelfe into diuers places, by the meanes which haue beene declared: ſo that the courſes of the waters in the earth are like the vaines in a mans bodie.<note place="margin">Goodly ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the courſe of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and of the vaines, which are in the body.</note> For euen as the ſoueraigne Creator hath placed the liuer in the bodies of liuing creatures, which is as the fountaine of blood needefull for all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to giue life thereto: and then hath made vaines like ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to diſperſe and diſtribute this blood to euerie member, diſpoſing them in ſuch ſort, as there is not any part but doth by meanes of theſe vaines receiue as much blood, as is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the nouriſhment and preſeruation of the life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſo likewiſe he hath ordayned heere below in earth, the ſea
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8737:151"/>
and ſprings of waters, which he afterwards diſpoſeth into euerie place by meanes of fountaines, floods and riuers, who are as the vaines through which the water, that is as the blood of the earth, is conueyed and communicated, that it may be moiſtned to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh all manner of fruits, which God hath commaunded it to beare for the nouriture both of men and beaſts. Wherefore as in one bodie there are many veines, ſome greater, larger, and longer; and ſome leſſer, narrower, and ſhorter, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe do all anſwere to one ſelfe ſame ſource and fountaine, and then doe diuide themſelues into ſundrie branches: ſo the earth hath her floods, riuers and ſtreames, ſome great, others ſmall, which haue all their common ſprings, and doe oftentimes ioine themſelues together, or diuide themſelues into diuers bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and armes, in ſuch ſort as the earth is moiſtened by them, ſo much as is needfull in euerie part thereof. Moreouer, as it is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to nouriſh the fruits; ſo men and other liuing creatures do thereby receiue their beuerage neceſſarie for the preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of pleaſure mixed with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in the works of God.</note>But amongſt all theſe things we are to conſider, that God the moſt-good hath not onely prouided by meanes of them for the neceſſities of his creatures, but euen for their honeſt pleaſures, ſo that it hath pleaſed him to conioyne an excellent beawtie with profit and vtilitie. For how goodly a thing is it to behold the fruitfull iſlands in midſt of the ſea, the cleere and ſweete bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſprings, and gentle riuers and floods iſſuing out of rockes and caues of the earth, which tumble downe the mountaines, flow through the vallies, and glide along the plaines, through forreſts, fields and medowes, being decked with many ſundrie kinds of branched trees, that are planted aſide from inhabitants; in middeſt of which, infinite little birdes flie vp and downe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their voices to ſing in ſweete melodie, and naturall muſick? What vnſpeakable pleaſure befalleth to all creatures, eſpecially to man, to liue amongſt ſuch abounding beawties? And who will not alſo admire the great varietie which is in the diſpoſition and diſtinction that wee behold in the earth, by the mountaines, rocks, valleies, plaines, fields, vineyards, medowes, woods and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts: eſpecially if we conſider the fruits and profits, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to men thereby, beſides the gallant diuerſitie of infinite delectable paſtures beawtified in all ſorts? For there is not one foote of earth, which may not be ſaid to ſerue to ſome good vſe,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:8737:151"/>
no not in moſt deſert places. Some places are fit for fields, and champion grounds; others for paſtures; ſome for vineyards; other for fruitfull orchards; and others for high and well growne trees fit for building timber, or for fire-wood, to the ende that men may helpe themſelues therewith in all their needfull vſes for firing. Some places alſo are particularly commodious for cattell to graze in, by which great gaine and pleaſure is receiued. And for deſerts, mountaines and forreſts, they are the proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyring places for wilde beaſts, by which likewiſe men do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue profit, but verie great delectation alſo, and healthfull exerciſe in hunting of them: and which is more, ſuch places are verie commodious for houſhold cattell, which do there feed in euerie place to maruellous profit. But let vs note, that all theſe properties and profits ſhould not be found in the earth, if it were not conioyned with the water by the courſe thereof thorough euerie part of it. Which water likewiſe doth cauſe many and vnſpeakable profits, that redound to men by fiſh, which remaine not onely in the ſea, but alſo in lakes, ponds and riuers, being of ſo ſundrie kindes and natures, that it is not poſſible to number them. In which if the prouidence of God be moſt admirable,<note place="margin">Commodities that the waters do bring in fiſhes, and what is to bee admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therein.</note> it is eſpecially to be obſerued in the ſea. For how many ſorts of fiſhes are there, great, little, and of meane quantitie; and how manie ſundrie formes, and what diuerſitie of Nature? I beleeue verily, that whoſoeuer ſhould vndertake to number them, by euerie kinde, and particularly, ſhould be almoſt as much troubled, as if he would purpoſe to emptie the Ocean. But though there be not any little creature in the ſea, wherein God doth not declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſhew himſelfe great and admirable; yet doth he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt himſelfe ſo to be in two things. The firſt is in the hugenes and power of the great fiſhes which he hath created, as whales and ſuch like, which ſeeme to be rather ſea-monſters then fiſhes, there being no beaſt in all the earth ſo great and ſtrong: for there are ſome that ſeeme a farre off to be iſlands or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, rather then fiſhes. And the other moſt wonderfull thing is, that the Creator hath ſet ſuch a correſpondencie in many points betwixt the fiſhes and beaſts of the earth, that it ſeemeth he would repreſent a great part of the one by the other. So we ſee alſo that many names of earthly beaſts are giuen to many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, becauſe of the ſimilitude and likenes, which they haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in figure and in nature: yea it ſeemeth that God would
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:8737:152"/>
repreſent in the fiſhes of the ſea, almoſt all the other creatures which are in the reſt of the world. For there are ſome which be called Stars, becauſe they are like that ſhape, according to which men commonly paint the ſtarres. Moreouer, how many are there which beare the ſhape of earthly creatures, yea of many inſtruments made by men?<note place="margin">Of the fiſh cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the cock.</note> For amongſt others, there is a fiſh called (the Cocke) which is alſo named by fiſhers in ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the Ioyner, becauſe it hath almoſt as much diuerſitie of bones and griſtles, as a Ioyner hath of tooles; the forme of which they alſo repreſent. But if we ſpeake of the ſundrie faſhions of fiſhes, and of their colours, ſcales, heads, skins &amp; fins, and of their vnderſtanding, induſtrie and chaſe, and of their ſhels and abiding places, and of their natures and infinite properties; who ſhould not haue iuſt cauſe to woonder? Moreouer, haue not men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged many faſhions of weapons, the forme of which they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from diuers fiſhes? What ſhall we alſo ſay of the finnes and little wings which God hath giuen them, to direct them, and to hold them vp in the ſea, and in other waters, like birds in the aire, and as ſhips are rowed and guided by oares, and the rudder? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it not that God hath created them like watrie birdes, to whom he hath giuen wings agreeable to the element for to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine themſelues with, and fit for their nature, as he hath done to the fowles of the aire?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1.</note> We alſo read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that the Lord did make in one day the birds and fiſhes, and euerie flying thing. For as the aire hath more agreement with the water (then with the earth) and approcheth neerer to the nature thereof; ſo is there more anſwerablenes betweene the creatures which liue &amp; conuerſe in theſe two elements, then is between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the beaſts of the earth: And therefore we ſee that the ſeed of both kindes is multiplied by their egs. And we muſt alſo note, that foraſmuch as men can receiue no great fruit, nor much profit by fiſh, except in their victuals, or in ſome medicine or ſuch like vſe, which is not ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon as ordinarie nouriſhment, God by his prouidence &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hath made them ſo fruitfull, that they multiplie and increaſe woondrouſly: as experience doth euidently manifeſt vnto vs, by the great number of frie or ſpawne that is found in one only fiſh. Which fertilitie we muſt beleeue to proceede from the power, which the Almightie beſtowed vpon them: as alſo vpon all his creatures, when he ſaid vnto them, [Bring foorth fruit, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie, and fill the waters in the ſea, and let the foule multiplie in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:8737:152"/>
the earth.] A thing which we muſt well conſider vpon, to the end that we may referre to this bleſſing of God all thoſe commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we daily receiue, either from thoſe creatures, or from the earth it ſelfe, or from the other elements, and that we muſt render him continuall thanks and praiſes therefore. For he hath in no leſſe wiſe bleſſed all his creatures, then the fiſhes and the birds, when by his word he gaue their nature to them, in which hee created them, and did preſently after command them to bring foorth fruit according vnto that nature. To the ende then that we may be the more induced to glorifie ſo great a worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for the excellencie of his workes, which ſhineth in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, let vs now intreat of ſome fiſhes moſt accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of by thoſe who haue written of their nature, and let vs conſider of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities and woonders, ſo much onely as the ſcope of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will permit vs, in ſuch ſort as we haue declared in our ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ſpeeches.

                  <p>IT is affirmed by all the learned, who haue diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſearched out the ſecrets of nature, that the water bringeth foorth both more and greater creatures, then the earth doth, bicauſe of the abundance of moiſture that is therein. And the ſea is ſo ample, and ſo fit to giue nouriſhment, and a gentle and fertile increaſe of all things, by meanes of that generating ſeede which it attracteth from heauen, and the aide of nature ordained by the creator (which hath this propertie, to produce alwaies ſomething that ſeemeth new) that it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if there be founde incredible and monſtrous things in the water. For the ſeedes of all forms doe ſo interlace and mix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therein, as well by the windes, as by the agitation of the waues, that one may well ſay (as is ſaid commonly) that there is nothing on earth, which is not in the ſea: yea,<note place="margin">The admirable property of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and that there are many things in it, which cannot be found either in the aire, or on the earth. Now great fiſhes are chiefly reſident vnder the Torrid zone, bicauſe that in the Ocean heate and moiſture ſerue for
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:8737:153"/>
augmentation,<note place="margin">Of the whale.</note> as ſaltnes doth for conſeruation. And in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is the whale, of which the ancients write, and whome ſome moderns call Gibbar (bicauſe that the common whale, which ſome take for the Muſculus of <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth not anſwere to the deſcription of this) which is of incredible hugenes. For if we will beleeue hiſtories, there haue beene ſome ſeene of fower acres of ground in length.<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 9. hiſt. nat.</note> They make an horrible crie, and ſpout out of two holes (of a cubite long, which they haue neere to their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils) ſo much water, that they oftentimes drowne ſhips there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And of their creſts men make faire rods, which ſeeme to be of bone, or of horne, blacke in colour, and like to the hornes of a buffe, ſo flexible, that they can hardly be broken, &amp; they do ſhine in the ſunne, as if they were gilded. Of euery peece of his creſt is a rod made, ſo that in one creſt there are many rods. Moreouer the bone of his whole head is ſo great, that one might make a ſhip thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the dolphin.</note>And as this kinde of fiſh is the heauieſt and mightieſt of all, ſo the dolphin is the ſwifteſt and moſt ingenious not onely of all watrie creatures, but of thoſe of the earth, and of the aire. For they ſwim faſter then a bird can flie. And therefore if this fiſh were not lowe-mouthed, there were no fiſh could ſcape him. But nature prouiding therefore, in putting his mouth vnder his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hath ſo reſtrained him, that he can catch nothing but back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: whereby the great ſwiftnes of ſuch fiſhes doth euidently appeere. Wherefore when the dolphin, preſſed with hunger, purſueth any fiſh to the bottome, and that he hath ſtaied long there, alwaies holding winde, when he riſeth he leapes aboue wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with incredible quicknes and force, to take breath againe. Some haue marked in this kinde of fiſh, that they haue their toong mooueable, contrarie to the nature of all other water-creatures. Their voice is as when one waileth. Their backe is bowed, and bendeth outwards: they are very louing to men, and like well of muſicke: and indeede they doe not ſhun men, as other fiſhes doe; but come right before ſhips, making a thouſand leapes and frisks before them. Sometimes alſo as if they had cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged the mariners to trie who ſhould goe ſpeedieſt, they take their courſe along with the ſhips, and doe outſtrip them, how good winde ſoeuer they haue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the ſeacalf.</note>Amongſt ſea-fiſh alſo the ſea-calfe is very admirable. For he hath vdders and haire, and calueth vpon the earth as ſheepe
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:8737:153"/>
bring foorth, and is deliuered of the ſecond burthen preſently after hir yoong ones. He ſnorts mightily when he ſleepeth neere to the ſhore; he bleates and bellowes like a calfe, and for that cauſe beareth the ſame name. The ſinnes wherewith he ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, ſerue for feete on ground to goe vpon. His hide (whereof the Iſlanders make girdles) hath a maruellous propertie, for the haire which is thereupon riſeth when the ſea increaſeth, &amp; falleth when it diminiſheth. Some holde alſo that this creature is very capable of diſcipline, eaſily learning that which is ſhewed him: and that he ſaluteth people by his lookes, and with a certaine noiſe and ſhaking that he makes.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſpeake of the tortoiſe which is of a very ſtrange forme. There are found of them in the coaſt of India ſo great,<note place="margin">Of Tortoiſes.</note> that one ſhell onely is ſufficient to couer a good pretie ſhed. And in the countrie of the Chelonophagi, there are ſome iſles, where they ordinarily vſe tortoiſe ſhels in ſtead of boates. For we muſt note that there be three ſorts of Tortoiſes: the terreſtriall, which breedeth in forreſts: mariſh ones, which breed in fens: and watry ones, which breed in the ſea. Thoſe then of this laſt ſort haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of feete ſo many broad griſtles: they haue no teeth, but the nibbe of their beake is paſſing ſharpe: and their vnderchappe doth cloſe as iuſtly within their vpper chap, as a boxe doth with the lidde of it. Being in the ſea, they liue vpon ſhell fiſhes, for their mouth is ſo ſtrong and hard, that they cruſh them, yea euen ſtones in peeces: yet when they come on land, they neuer liue but vpon herbes. They lay egges like birds; ſo that ſometimes one may finde an hundred togither. And they neuer hatch them in the water, but putting them into an hole which they make in the ground, and couering them well, they ſmooth with their ſhels vnderneath the place wherein they are, and hatch in the night time for a whole yeere long.</p>
                  <p>Alſo amongſt the fiſhes which are famous for their ſtrange operatiue power, is the Torpedo or crampfiſh:<note place="margin">Of the cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh.</note> which is a kind of hedgehogge, &amp; hath many briſtles, the touch of whom be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the fiſhers hands, by ſome naturall and ſecret vertue. And there be many kindes of theſe fiſhes, who haue all of them their ſhell couered with briſtles very thicke, which briſtles they vſe in ſtead of feete to ſtaie themſelues vpon, when they mooue and ſtirre from one place to another. Their head and mouth is the loweſt part of them, and towards the ground. And amongſt the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:8737:154"/>
reſt, there is one, not of the kinde of this briſtled crampfiſh, but a ſhell fiſh, which the Latins call <hi>(Remora)</hi> becauſe it hath ſuch power that if it take hold of the bottome of ſhips, it ſtaieth them. Yet we cannot read that any ſuch thing hath beene ſeene ſince the time of <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> the emperor: whom Hiſtoriographers report to haue beene one time ſtaied in his ſhip by this fiſh to his great endommagement.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the Triton.</note>But the moſt woonderfull of all fiſhes is the Triton, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called the ſea Bugge) for hee hath haire vpon his head, the noſe of a man, a broad mouth, and the teeth of a wilde beaſt. His hands, fingers, and nailes, are ſomewhat like thoſe of a man. And the reſt of his bodie is couered with a thinne ſhell, with a taile vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his belly in ſtead of feete like a dolphin.<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 9.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Of the Nereides.</note>The Nereides alſo (otherwiſe called Sirens or Mermaides) do very neere approch to humane forme, ſauing that they bee rough and ful of ſhels in euery part of their body. There are ſome alſo who teſtifie that they haue ſeene a ſea-man, hauing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire forme of a man. Finally it is a thing that ſeemeth altogither incredible that the diuerſitie of fiſhes, (or rather ſea-monſters) ſhould be ſuch as they affirme, who haue written thereof. But we may well beleeue, that the facilitie of generation and of life in the waters,<note place="margin">Of the cauſe of innumerable formes of fiſhes.</note> is cauſe of ſo many ſtrange ſhapes. For heate and moiſture conſiſt togither in generation, and nouriſhment main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth life: and in the ſea heate and fatte moiſture, and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do abound. It is alſo to be noted, that by reaſon of motion, the peſtilence neuer commeth into the water, (as into the aire) for the ſea is euer mooued, and the aire is often ſtill. For which cauſe all kindes of creatures may eaſily be preſerued in the ſea, but not ſo in the aire. Againe, fiſhes mooue themſelues in the ſea eaſily, and without labour: which the beaſts of the earth do not, who therefore are conſtrained to be hungrie, or neceſſarily to be conſumed by too much labour and trauaile. Moreouer the ſea freezeth not, neither yet is too hot (like the earth, and like other waters) except it be (and that very ſeldome) in the ſuperficies thereof, which is touched by the aire. Therefore through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie commodities, and by the mixture of creatures of diuers kindes, many monſters are engendred in the ſea, ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:8737:154"/>
when it ariſeth, by meanes of the flowing thereof, one may finde vpon the ſhore of the weſterne Ocean to the number of three hundred kindes of monſtrous fiſhes. But although it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that nature would expreſſe in fiſhes the formes of all terreſtriall creatures, &amp; put in them ſome reſemblance of ſhape; yet in the hinder part all fiſhes are (except ſome fewe ſea-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) of a peculiar forme agreeable to their nature, and do one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſemble other creatures in the forepart. For as the rudder directeth and gouerneth a ſhip in the ſterne, ſo the taile of a fiſh doth guide it in ſwimming. And for this cauſe the tailes of all fiſhes almoſt are forked. But this is moſt certaine that their ſorts and kinds ſurmount the kindes of other creatures in multitude, in greatnes, in force, and in varietie of ſhapes. But our intent is not heere to number them as we haue ſaid: for ſo we ſhould finde matter enough to make a great volume, as others haue done. Wherefore to finiſh this argument, and this daies ſpeech, ſee (ACHITOB) if by our diſcourſes of the ſea &amp; of the waters, and of the liuing creatures which are engendred &amp; do liue in them, you can deliuer any inſtruction, which may be anſwerable to that end, for which we eſpecially continue our treatiſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this great vniuers.</p>

Yea when this wicked world ſheweth vs faireſt countenance, &amp; becommeth moſt calme and gentle, and that it feedeth vs with the fatteſt morſels; then is it moſt falſe vnto vs, and then are we in greateſt danger.

we thinke our ſelues moſt ſure therein, then are we ſodainly toſt and carried away, as with violent waues and horrible whire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds, into the loweſt gulfes and deepes of the earth.

                  <p>But heere we are to note, that although there be ſome kinds of beaſts who eate one another: yet are they not all of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For there are but certaine of them that liue ſo vpon praie and rapine. And amongſt them that ſo liue, there are but verie fewe that eate beaſtes of their owne kinde, except great famine conſtraine them thereto: Yea hunger doth inuite them that liue by pray, to chaſe and deuour others, rather then their owne kinde. For it is neceſſitie and want of ſuſtenance that driueth them thereto. And though eſpecially fiſhes do leaſt ſpare their owne kinde, yet doe they not eate one another, except when
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8737:155"/>
hunger conſtraineth them thereto to preſerue their life.<note place="margin">How men are more cruell then beaſts.</note> But men (moſt wretched ſurely) haue not all theſe cauſes to mooue them againſt their own kind, againſt their owne fleſh and bloud, as it is ordinarily ſeene that they are more cruelly and more fiercely bent one againſt another, then any bruite beaſts: but contrariwiſe they ſhoulde be much better furniſhed in all their neceſſities, and ſhould liue much more at their eaſe, if they could maintaine good peace and vnitie one with another. Wherefore in that they do otherwiſe, it is eaſie to iudge how much their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is corrupted &amp; peruerſe, except they be regenerated by the ſpirite of God. For there is no bond of nature whatſoeuer, no not that which is kept amongſt the bruteſt beaſts (as of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male towards her yoong ones, or of the male towards the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and ſuch like) which men do not ſhamefully breake and violate. But we muſt herein acknowledge a terrible iudgment &amp; furie of God againſt them, bicauſe of their ſin, which hath ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and infected the firſt original nature of the ſtock of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. For when he giueth ſtrength and power to the one for to torment and deſtroy the other, yea to moſt cruell tyrants and bloudie murtherers, who make leſſe account of men then of beaſts; we muſt learne this doctrine, that herein the iuſt ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Almightie is very euident, by which he puniſheth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the wicked,<note place="margin">Good doctrine touching the tyrannie of the wicked.</note> &amp; taketh reuenge vpon his enimies euen by his enimies the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as he hath threatned them in his law. And therefore there is leſſe maruel herein, then that God ſuffreth the ſmall fiſhes to be eaten by great ones; the weakeſt by the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; and the ſimpleſt by the craftieſt; as alſo the gentleſt birds by the cruelleſt; and lambes, ſheepe, and other priuate, domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and harmeleſſe beaſts; by woolues, beares, lyons, and other wilde beaſts. For it is very certaine that the beaſts haue not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their creator, nor deſerued his wrath through any ſinne againſt him, as men haue done, who being created in his owne image are fallen from innocencie and holines through their own fault, &amp; through the corruption of nature which the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods ordinance hath brought vpon them. And if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make anſwere for the cauſe of this nature of vnreaſonable creatures, but onely that it hath ſo pleaſed God, who is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and lord of all theſe works, and who hath prouided for them according to his good pleaſure: ſurely alſo when we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no other reaſon for the tyrannie and crueltie of men, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:8737:156"/>
one vpon another, this ſame reaſon ſhould then ſuffice vs. For the onely will of the eternall, the which cannot be but iuſt and reaſonable alwaies, muſt euer ſerue for a reaſon, when wee cannot vnderſtand the cauſes, as we would. But (as I ſaide euen now) this reaſon manifeſteth it ſelfe ſufficiently in his iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon men, bicauſe of their ſinnes. Now albeit wee holde this ſufficiently good in regard of the wicked, and of thoſe who oppoſe themſelues and rebell fiercely againſt the Almightie: yet the conſideration might ſeeme to vs to be otherwiſe in reſpect of the meeke, and of thoſe whome he holdeth not onely for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, but alſo for his beloued children: who neuertheleſſe are commonly a pray to the wicked, as ſheepe are to woolues. I muſt indeed confeſſe, that theſe iudgements of God ſeeme more ſtrange to humane reaſon, then the other do: yet they are not ſo ſecret and myſticall, but that he manifeſteth cauſes enough, not onely by his worde,<note place="margin">Notable things to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities of the good.</note> but alſo by common experience. For firſt, how much goodnes, holines and perfection ſoeuer can conſiſt in any man, yet neuertheles as concerning his fleſh, he walloweth altogither in ſinne, and very much naturall corruption, in pride, arrogancie, rebellion, and diſobedience againſt God, which haue great neede to bee better mortified, humbled, tamed, and brought downe. Againe how eaſie a matter is it for vs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our Creator, and our owne ſelues, and to abuſe all the graces and benefits, which we receiue continually at his hand? Alſo ſeeing that he will be glorified, and that his power ſhall be knowne in the faith, conſtancie, charitie, and patience of his; we ſhould not thinke it ſtrange that he puts them to triall, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them by diuers great and dangerous temptations and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Now the tyrannie, malice, crueltie, and peruerſnes of the wicked, ſerueth in all theſe things for his children, and to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, through his prouidence; notwithſtanding that he hateth all the wicked, vſing them only as rods and ſcourges, to chaſtiſe and puniſh thoſe whom he pleaſeth; as he is likewiſe ſerued by diuels, without approouing their works, inſomuch as they proceed from themſelues. But there is more yet: For conſidering that God hath not created men like vnto beaſts, onely to liue in this world, with a corporall &amp; temporall life, but hath made them to immortality and eternall life like the angels: he will then by the aduerſities, which he ſendeth vnto them, heere giue them to vnderſtand, that other bleſſings doe attend for them far greater then thoſe, which
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:8737:156"/>
may be taſted vpon earth, and which are common betwixt them and beaſts. Behold then the fruit, which me ſeemeth muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in our diſcourſe this day: now to morrow wee will ſtep out of the ſea and waters, to take land againe, and to conſider vpon the treaſures and benefits therein, which it produceth for the commoditie of men, and the diuerſitie of creatures that liue therein: whereof (ASER) you ſhall begin to diſcourſe.</p>

For all herbes, trees, and plants that the earth euer hath borne, doth beare, or ſhall beare, euen from the creation of the ſame vntill the end of the world, doe proceede from the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and eternall word of the ſoueraigne, by which all things haue beene created. Wherefore <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the ende that men might acknowledge this diuine power, which maketh the earth ſo fruitful, doth expreſſely tell vs, that God gaue this fertilitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any ſunne, moone, or ſtarre in heauen. For hee ſaith, that theſe goodly lights were created the fourth day: but
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:8737:157"/>
that the production of herbs,<note place="margin">What is the cauſe of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the earth.</note> trees &amp; plants was on the third day. Thereby then we muſt learne, that although the ſun, moone and ſtarres, beſides the husbandrie of man, do ſerue by the ordinance of God for to make the earth fertile; yet for all that it can bring foorth no fruit, if the word and bleſſing of the Almightie do not giue it power. For as it was fertile before it was aided by the ſtarres, euen ſo is it now in regarde of the tillage and husbandrie of man. For there was neither man nor beaſt when it budded foorth the fruites, which God commanded it to beare: yea ſo much wanteth it to become fruitful by the trauell of man, that to the contrarie it hath loſt very much fertilitie, and a great part thereof hath become barren ſince his firſt creation, bicauſe of his ſinne. For in lieu of the bleſſing that God at firſt gaue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.</note> he ſaid afterwards to the man that it ſhould be curſed for his ſake, and that it ſhould bring foorth thornes and thiſtles, and that he ſhould eate the fruits thereof in ſorrow. For theſe cauſes then we muſt alwaies haue reſpect to the power of the word, and of the bleſſing of God, by which all things haue been created in their order (as we haue heretofore declared) and man laſt of al, as the maſter-peece of the Lords worke. Who hauing determined in his eternall counſell to create man after his owne image and likenes (to the end that he might in this viſible world repreſent his creator, as in his moſt liuely ſemblance) was not onely pleaſed to build him his lodging firſt (to wit the whole world) but would alſo repleniſh and furniſh it euery where, to the end that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be found emptie. But that which is herein to bee chiefly conſidered, is, that this diuine prouidence hauing giuen eſſence to all corporall creatures, hath therewithall prouided ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie meanes to keepe and preſerue them all in their natures. For minding to giue life to birds, to fiſhes, and to the beaſtes of the earth, he had already prepared their foode, before he had created them, and had ordained the earth as the mother and the nurſe of all creatures which are engendred and which dwell and are conuerſant therein;<note place="margin">How creatures are nouriſhed, and preſerued.</note> and in the waters and aire alſo, for the birds and fiſhes. Moreouer as all bodies are compoſed of fire, of aire, of earth, and of water; ſo the Lords will was, that all theſe enimies ſhould conioine togither, and receiue aide one from another; to the preſeruation of liuing creatures by vertue of the alliance and agreement, which is not onely betwixt the ſaid ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but alſo betwixt them and the celeſtiall ſpheres, as wee
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:8737:157"/>
haue alreadie diſcourſed. For conſidering that they be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of things hauing life, they cannot liue, nor be naturally conſerued but by meane of the very ſame elements, from which they take their originall. And therefore the prouidence of God cauſeth, that they doe all accord togither, to nouriſh and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoſe creatures, which he hath made and created.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing that we are in talke of the fertilitie of the Earth,<note place="margin">Of the fertility of the earth.</note> ordayned by God to that ende, according as we haue declared, who is it that can number the diuers kinds of herbs, of trees, and of all ſorts of plants which it produceth? And who is it that can but onely name and finde proper denominations agreeable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? And if we ſhould ſpeake of their diuerſities and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in rootes, in ſtalks, in ſtockes, in tops, in branches, in boughes, in leaues, in ſhapes, in flowers, in colours, in ſeeds, in fruits, in taſtes, in ſmels, and in ſauours: who would not maruell verie much? We ſee how the Lord ſpeaking onely of the Lilly of the field, doth teſtifie, that <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his royaltie was not ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like one of thoſe: and therefore he bringeth it as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his goodnes in reproch of thoſe, which take care for their clothing, as if they diſtruſted in the prouidence of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.</note> and as if they ſuppoſed him not able enough to apparell them; or at leaſt, that he had not ſo much care of men, as he hath of the herbs and flowers of the field, which he endueth and decketh with ſo gallant clothing, &amp; with ſo many ſorts of excellent faire colours, and yet they neither ſpinne nor haue weauers, nor clothiers, nor drapers, nor other worke-folks and tradeſmen to deale for them. Yea, how maruellous is the conſeruation and multiplication of all plants, by meanes of their owne ſeeds, ſyons and fruits, according as the Creator did at firſt conſtitute? For that I may firſt ſpeake of the ſmaller ſort, who could beleeue, if experience did not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs, that of one little graine of muſtard ſeede ſhould grow a great and high plant, like a little ſhrub,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.</note> in ſuch ſort that the birds of heauen might make their neſts therein? Then let vs conſider, how corne, pulſe, and all other ſorts of ſeeds do bud, grow, and multiply. But who of himſelfe would iudge, that out of one little kernell of a nut or filberd, there could grow ſo great trees, and ſo much wood, as ſhould beare innumerable leaues and buds, and ſo much fruit each yeere, euerie one according to his owne kinde, and that for long time? Would not all this ſeeme incredible, if we were not aſcertained by continuall experience, and a ſure
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:8737:158"/>
courſe in Nature? And if God doth ſhew himſelfe moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all theſe things, in regard of the herbes, trees and plants: what ſhall we ſay, if we proceed to the conſideration of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, properties and vertues; and of the commodities, remedies and profits,<note place="margin">Woonders concerning the properties, and virtues of the fruites of the earth.</note> which men receiue thereby? This ſurely is the moſt principall point. For how admirable is it, that by the meanes of herbes, trees, and other plants, which haue no ſoule, that may miniſter life vnto them, with motion and ſenſe, and which may much leſſe participate with any reaſon; God doth not onely preſerue the life of men, and of other creatures (a thing to bee woondred at) but doth alſo thereby giue them ſtrength, vigour, and force? For what are theſe herbs and plants, which produce all ſorts of corne, pulſe, and other graine, of which men make foode, and are thereby nouriſhed? What is the vine and other fruit-trees? Who could thinke, if he ſaw it not with his eies, that there is neither man, nor beaſt, that could be nouriſhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue his life, but by ſuch meanes? For how can that thing either giue, or preſerue and maintaine life, which hath no life in it ſelfe? And yet if we will conſider of the medicines and remedies, which men finde in herbes and plants onely, beſides thoſe which they may take from other creatures, who can in truth either declare or write, I wil not ſay all of them, but onely the thouſandth part? For although the moſt excellent phiſitions haue alwaies trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this part of their art, which is commonly called the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Symples; yet how farre off are they from the full and perfect theoricke of them? For what a number of herbes and rootes be there which are vnknowen, and haue yet no name? And how many are there which are taken one for another, and wherein the moſt skilful Phiſitions and Herbariſts are oftentimes deceiued? And yet this little which we know, ſhould mooue vs to thinke vpon the great and ineffable bountie of God towards men, and vpon the fatherly care which he hath of vs all. For though that by our ſinnes we haue merited death both of bodie and ſoule, which death our ſinne hath not onely gained, but alſo many diuers and ſtrange ſorts of diſeaſes and corporall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties moſt grieuous and terrible; yea ſometimes hideous and horrible, which are like butchers and ſlaughterers to put them to death: yet the charitie and loue of our God is alwaies ſo great towards mankinde, that he giueth vs as many and more; yea ſundrie medicines for one onely maladie. But we will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:8737:158"/>

                  <p>IT is daily ſeene, that by the meanes of ſome ſmall herbes, which grow in a garden or in a mountaine, or in ſome other deſert place, and which alſo are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes troden vnder foote, without any account made of them; many are commonly deliuered, not onely from great paines and grieuous maladies, but euen from death it ſelfe, which otherwiſe it ſeemeth would moſt certainely approch. Wherin certes, we haue a goodly ſubiect to conſider, that if God giueth this vertue to creatures of ſmall eſtimation in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of many others, and that by the meanes of them hee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth ſo great helpe, and doth ſo much good to man; what muſt be the power and bounty of that great and ſoueraigne phiſition, which maketh them preuaile, and giues them power to heale? For wee muſt vnderſtand, that it is not the herbes, nor other drugs and preparatiues, nor yet the apothecaries and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, who make and compound them, that are the true cauſe of reſtored-health to the ſicke: but God alone, who doth not onely giue the remedies, but alſo knowledge to men how for to vſe them, and to be skilfull how to apply them to their owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, for which he hath created them. Herein then we muſt acknowledge two great benefits, that the moſt good and moſt puiſſant God hath conferred vpon vs. The firſt is,<note place="margin">Two great good things that God hath done for man.</note> that he hath giuen vs medicines fit and neceſſarie for healing. The other is the knowledge of them, and the theoricke how to apply them to their conuenient purpoſe and vſage. And one of theſe benefits without the other, would indeede but little auaile vs. For as the workman cannot worke without ſuch ſtuffe as is requiſite for him to make his worke of, as alſo it would be vnprofitable if no man ſhould employ it, and put it to vſe: for the ſame cauſe, God, which taketh care of the leaſt of his creatures, hath imprinted in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:8737:159"/>
the nature of brute beaſts, that want vnderſtanding and reaſon, a certaine knowledge of things that are fit for them, not onely for their nouriſhment, but alſo for remedies in their diſeaſes, ſo that they neede no other phiſitions but themſelues onely.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt bee made of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that the fruits of the earth do retaine for the good of men.</note>But in this diſcourſe we are to note, what iudgement we muſt make of ſo great vertue, as we finde in all herbes and drugs, and by like reaſon, that we muſt conſider thereof in the propertie of corne, bread, wine, and of all meates and drinks, which are as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and continuall medicines for the preſeruation of life. For if that which is diminiſhed and conſumed daily in vs, were not alſo repaired and reſtored daily by our meate and drinke; wee ſhould fall ſuddenly into greeuous maladies, and finally into death. Foraſmuch then as it pleaſeth God to preſerue the life, which he hath giuen vs, and to maintaine vs in health and good diſpoſition; he giueth power to that, which we eate and drinke, to doe this. But if it ſhould pleaſe him to doe otherwiſe, there were neither meate nor drinke, which could giue any ſuſtenance and conuenient nouriſhment vnto vs, but would rather conuert within vs, into deadly poyſon, to take away our life, and haſten our death, euen as God doth oftentimes to that effect vſe the aire, without which we could no more liue, then without meate and drinke. And therefore when it pleaſeth God that we ſhall liue in health and long time; he maketh the aire good and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for vs: if otherwiſe it pleaſeth him to ſtrike vs with ſicknes, and to haſten our death, he changeth it, as if it were impoiſoned, as we doe very often finde in diuers contagious ſickneſſes, and chiefly in time of peſtilence. The like alſo is in victuals, drinks, and medicines. And therefore the Lord menaceth his people by <hi>Iſaie,</hi> declaring vnto them, that he will take away the ſtaffe of bread and of water: that is to ſay, the ſubſtance and naturall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which he hath giuen them to nouriſh, which is the force that ſuſtaineth them, who are ſuſtained, as a ſtaffe ſuſtaineth him that is weake: and as man cannot liue, except he haue both meate and drinke ſufficient; the prophet hath compriſed vnder bread and water, all things needfull for nouriſhment, and for the life of man. It is therefore in theſe things, that God ſaith, he will take away all power,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.</note> as alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> doth amply declare in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and curſes of the lawe. For let vs alſo note, that when God will puniſh men by dearth and famine, he doth not onely make the earth barren (as he threatneth) but alſo curſeth that little
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:8737:159"/>
fruit, which it beareth, yea in ſuch ſort, that it ſtill diminiſheth, and hath not the accuſtomed vertue and power to nouriſh. And therefore, when the corne is ſowne, it yeeldeth not ſo many eares nor ſo many graines in the field, as is expected, and as it ſeemeth that it ſhould yeeld. And afterwards when it is gathered and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and that it commeth to be threſhed, there is yet found leſſe corne then was eſteemed to be. And being laid vp in the barne, it conſumeth more then of cuſtome: carried to the mill, it yeelds leſſe meale then is looked for: yea being kneaden into dough it ſeemeth to diminiſh: briefly it ſeemeth to faile being made in paſte, brought to the ouen, and ſo baked, when it is in the binne, &amp; vpon the table, yea in the hand, in the mouth, in the ſtomack, and in the bellie. For it doth not ſatisfie, nouriſh, and ſuſtaine ſo well as in time of plentie and abundance, but they which feede thereof, are alwaies hungrie and famiſhed. And ſo we may thinke of all other meates and drinks: euen as we finde the contrarie in the bleſſing of God, when through it he giueth fruitfulnes to the earth, and abundance of all things, according to the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his word. As then we are admoniſhed to haue recourſe to him onely, to demaund our daily bread, and all other things needefull for this life: ſo muſt wee alſo doe, when wee are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by ſickneſſe. For hee is the ſoueraigne and onely phiſition, who can of himſelfe heale vs. It is hee that ſtriketh, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth remedie, which bringeth to the graue, and draweth out againe; which killeth, and raiſeth vp againe. And therefore hee ſaith to his people by <hi>Moſes,</hi> [If thou wilt diligently har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto the voice of the Lorde thy God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.</note> and wilt doe that which is right in his ſight, and wilt giue eare vnto his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and keepe all his ordinances; then will I put none of theſe diſeaſes vpon thee, which I brought vpon the Egyptians: for I am the Lorde that healeth thee.] But although that God alone can doe all things, without the aide of any creature, and without the vſe of any meanes, except he pleaſe:<note place="margin">Why God doth ſerue himſelfe with his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures towards man.</note> yet doth he chooſe out ſuch meanes as he pleaſeth, to performe his works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, and to diſtribute his gifts, and that chiefly for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The firſt is, for that he will not haue his creatures remaine idle, but ſerue to his glory, and for the good and health of men, conſidering that they were created to that end. And the other cauſe is, that it pleaſeth him to accommodate himſelfe to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, which is ſuch, as we do not thinke that he is neere vnto
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:8737:160"/>
vs, nor that he can or will do it, except we haue alwaies ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſignes. Although then it is as eaſie for him to nouriſh vs without victuales and without drinke, as with them, and to heale vs without Phiſitions and medicines and drugs, as hee doth by meanes of them: neuertheleſſe it is his pleaſure to do it by ſuch aides, and he will haue vs ſubiect to this order. And therefore let vs thinke, that to deſpiſe the meanes which he giueth for the maintenance of this life, is as much as to deſpiſe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, like mockers and rebels. And if we be ſuch, we may not hope for any ſuccours from him, ſeeing we reiect the remedies, by which he will giue them vnto vs. But we muſt alwaies come to this point, that although wee cannot receiue the benefits which it pleaſeth the moſt good God to communicate vnto vs, except by the meanes ordained by his prouidence thereto; yet neuertheleſſe we muſt not attribute this power to any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but to him onely, and muſt giue him the whole glory; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that he taketh them not for any need which he hath, or that without them he could not performe his works, but onelie for the aide and ſupportation of our infirmitie. And therefore let vs beleeue, that bread, wine, and all other meates, drinkes, drugs and medicines, haue not any vertue of themſelues, but ſo much onely, as God infuſeth into them, and as he thinketh need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for our good, by ſuch inſtruments as he ordaineth thereto. Wherefore men runne in vaine to ſuch aides, and eſpecially to Phiſitions and apothecaries to be ſuccoured by them, except God the ſoueraigne Phiſition do put his hand thereto, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he bleſſe their arte and labour.<note place="margin">Of the true vſe of phiſick, and how it is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> Experience certainly doth yeelde vs daily teſtimonie thereof. For it oftentimes hapneth that in ſtead of helping, Phiſitions do hurt; and in ſtead of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, do kill. And how ſo? Becauſe there are very fewe which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe themſelues to the true and Almightie Phiſition, and who haue not more confidence in mortall men then in the immortall God, as king <hi>Aſa</hi> is accuſed in the Scripture, and puniſhed for this fault with death. True it is, that ſome faile, in that which they make none account of the ordinarie meanes eſtabliſhed by God, deſpiſing both Phiſitions and al the medicines of their arte, which is almoſt as much, as to refuſe the vſage of thoſe benefits which God giueth vs at need. But the greateſt number conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of thoſe, who not onely haue recourſe chiefly to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of this ſcience, and put all their confidence in them, but will
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:8737:160"/>
moreouer in ſtead of vſing the aduiſe and aſſiſtance of good and learned phiſitions, addreſſe themſelues more willingly to Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, and ſuch as are ignorant, or elſe are ſorcerers, enchanters, witches and worſhippers of diuels. If then our deſire be, not to faile with the one nor the other, we muſt reſt in that way which is ſhewed vs in Eccleſiaſticus, to wit, [Honor the Phiſicion with that honor that is due vnto him, becauſe of thy neceſſitie:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 38.</note> for the Lord hath created him. For of the moſt high commeth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the Phiſition ſhall receiue gifts of the king. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Phiſition lifteth vp his head, and he ſhall be in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Lord hath created medicines of the earth, &amp; he that is wiſe will not abhorre them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.</note> Was not the water made ſweete with wood, that men might know the vertue thereof? So hath he giuen men knowledge, that he might be glorified in his woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works.] Which is as much to ſay, that as God hath ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the bitternes of the waters in the deſart, by meanes of woode which he cauſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to caſt thereinto; ſo likewiſe doth he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his power by the arte of Phiſicke, ſhewing marueilous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereby. And therefore the wiſe man doth adde [With medicines God healeth men, and taketh away their paines. Of ſuch doth the apothecarie make a confection, and yet he cannot finiſh his owne worke, for of the Lord commeth proſperitie and health ouer all the earth.] And finally he exhorteth the ſicke to praie: ſaying, [My ſonne faile not in thy ſicknes, but praie vnto the Lord, and he will make thee whole: leaue off from ſinne, and order thine hands aright, and clenſe thine hart from all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Then giue place to the phyſition, for the Lord hath created him: let him not goe from thee, for thou haſt need of him. The hower may come that their enterpriſes may haue good ſucceſſe: for they alſo pray vnto the Lord, that he woulde proſper that, which is giuen for eaſe, and their phiſicke for the prolonging of life.] Wherein namely this holy perſonage doth euidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, what is the vertue of phiſitions, if they deſire, that the Lord would bleſſe their works, without whoſe bleſſing they can neuer come to a proſperous ende. Behold then what ſeemed good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me to note concerning the true vſe of the great and excellent gifts, which God communicateth with vs for the maintenance of mans life. And purſuing this ſubiect, let vs ſpeake ſomthing more particularly concerning the diuerſity and ſingularitie of diuers plants: the diſcourſe whereof (ARAM) I commit to you.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Foure kindes of plants.</note>THE learned teach, that there are fower kindes of plants, to wit, trees, ſhrubs, vnder-ſhrubs and herbes. Now a tree is that, whoſe ſtocke waxeth greene euerie yeere, and therefore groweth to great height, as the peare-tree. The ſhrub called of Latines <hi>(Frutex)</hi> is that whoſe ſtocke remaineth for many yeeres together, but it groweth not verie high (as the roſe-tree and the myrtle.) The vnder-ſhrub called <hi>(Subfrutex)</hi> reſteth alſo vpon the ſtock, but exceedeth not the height of herbes (as the broome.) And the herbe is that which hath neither ſtalke nor ſtock (as houſleeke &amp; ſage:) or elſe hath a ſtock, but ſo as it changeth euery yeere (as the fennell.) And yet a fift kind may be added between the herbe &amp; the ſhrub (as rue:) bicauſe that ſometimes it groweth great like a ſhrub, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remaineth like other herbes, which is alſo vſuall to the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage. But generally all plants may attaine to great height by husbandrie. Alſo amongſt ſallet-herbes, ſpecially thoſe which are greene, doe oftentimes growe into ſhrubs, by the induſtrie of man in winter time: whereby it appeereth, that we muſt not take the true difference of plants, and of their kindes, by their greatnes or growth: no more then in that the leaues of plants are not all of one bignes, or bicauſe they alwaies ſtay vpon ſome, and fall off from others: or bicauſe they differ in colour, or elſe bicauſe one plant is barren,<note place="margin">In what wee muſt take the difference of plants.</note> and another beareth fruit. But wee muſt take this difference in foure things, which are the vertue and propertie, the odour, the ſauor, and the ſhape of the leaues, buds, fruit, barke and rootes, and generally of the whole plant. Of which fower differences the principall is the facultie, vertue, or propertie: for the vertue proceedeth from the forme, and the forme is that which diſtinguiſheth the kindes. And therefore though the willowe, and the Vitex (called Agnus caſtus) haue their leaues and barke alike, it ſhould neuertheles be a manifeſt error to vſe the one for the other. For the Vitex is hot and drie in the third degree (of which it hath this marke, that it driueth
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:8737:161"/>
away ventoſities, and flouriſheth firſt amongſt all trees:) but the willow is cold and moiſt, flouriſhing very late, and cauſing ventoſities. Now for the odour or ſent, one may euidently knowe by them the temperature of plants. And therefore they which are of one kinde, although the one growe in India, and the other in Scythia, yet doe they neceſſarily participate with the ſelfe ſame principall vertues. And for the ſauour and figure, they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the taſte and eie: wherein it is neceſſarie to imploy much diligence and labour, to iudge well concerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of plants. Thoſe then which are alike in forme, in power, in odour, and in taſte, may without doubt bee accounted of one ſelfe ſame kinde: For we ſearch out the names of them according to their vertues. Whereupon enſueth, that they which haue one ſelfe ſame vertue, may be compriſed vnder one kinde, though the herbaliſt call them by ſundrie names, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their figure.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome plants doe growe naturally in fieldes, and foreſts, ſome in the ſea, others in riuers, others on the ſhore ſide, ſome in mariſhes, ſome amongſt ſtones, ſands, and grauell, ſome in pits, and ſo of others in ſuch like places. For the place, in which they growe, or to which they are remooued (and the temperature of the aire) are much auailable to cauſe them growe, and fructifie. Through which occaſion, there are higher trees, more flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, fairer to behold, and more charged with leaues, and fruit,<note place="margin">The place, and temperature of the aire, of great efficacy in the production of plants.</note> in ſome places, rather then in other. Whereupon enſueth that ſuch as loue mountaines (as the Cedar, Saple, Pine, the Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tree, Box tree, Iuniper tree, Beech, and the Plane-tree) doe there growe high, and faire: as in the plaines and lowe forreſts, the Oke, the Beech, the Corke-tree, the Elme, the Maple, the Aſh, the Haſell-tree doe growe beſt. But neere to riuers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>atrie places, the Plane-tree, the Alder, the white and blacke Poplar, the Tamariske, the Willow and the Reede doe ſping at pleaſure: though many of them doe growe in mountaines, val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, plaines and forreſts, but they proſper not there ſo well. This difference alſo is marked in herbes and ſhrubs. For ſome growe well in mariſhes, others in lakes and pooles, others on riuers ſides, other proſper in watriſh and muddie places, others againe not abiding them, doe growe in drie and ſtonie ground. Some ſpring indifferently both in moiſt and drie ground. And ſome require the fields, others vineyards, and others meadowes. Some
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:8737:162"/>
alſo loue the valleies, others hillocks, &amp; others high mountaines. Some likewiſe proſper in priuate places, and growe neere to wals of townes and cities, and ſome growe in old ruines. But it is to be noted, that though each kinde of plants growe and proſper beſt in his proper ground, and doth loue very much his owne naturall ſituation; yet ſometimes herbs are found indifferently in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, hillocks, valleies, fields and meadowes. Likewiſe the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie and trauell of man doth bring to paſſe, that that which is ſtrange, becommeth domeſticall; yet not without ſome manifeſt difference between the pure naturall production, and that which is cauſed by arte. Moreouer the parts of plants are, the roote, the ſtocke,<note place="margin">The parts of plants.</note> the branches, the leaues, the fruit, the ſtalke, the tufts cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (Vmbellae) the graines, the ſeedes, the flowers, the moſſie-downe, the wood, the barke, the ſinewes, the inner pil, the vaines, the ſap, the pith, the gum called (Lachryma) the knot, and many other ſmall parcels, which the curious obſerue therein: all which ſerue to diſtinguiſh trees and herbes one from another: which parts are ſomewhat anſwerable to the parts of liuing creatures. For the roots ſeeme to agree with the bellie (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) or elſe with the mouth (as others maintaine, who referre the lower part of the ſtocke to the bellie) and the leaues haue ſome reference to the haire; the barke to the hide and skin, the wood to the bones, the vaines to the vaines, the matrice to ſome entrailes, which cannot liue without the matrice, the flowers to egges, the ſeedes to ſeede, the branches and boughes to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme parts of liuing creatures, and the fruit to the menſtruous blood, wherein the ſeede is many times incloſed. Moreouer the parts of parts are woorthie of conſideration, as thoſe of the roote, whoſe middle part is as it were of wood, out of which the plant doth oftentimes bud, and is therefore defended with greater ſtrength. And therefore if this middle part bee taken out of garlicke, that which remaineth is not ſo ſharpe, and of ſo ſtrong ſauour as before, and it ſeemeth likewiſe to bee leſſe full of iuice. Next, the ſecond part is (the rinde or coate) which is very ſmall, and the third is the peele or huske: and the fourth is the inner-peele, which enuironeth the huske, which is not properly called ſo, becauſe it is ment for that, which compaſſeth the ſeede of the fruit, and the fruit it ſelfe; and alſo becauſe it contayneth that which enuironeth the wood in the root, inſteed of the ſeed. Whereby it appeereth, that they which caſt away this part full of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:8737:162"/>
wood when they make their decoctions, do verie ill, conſidering that it is the moſt excellent of all the reſt, and of greateſt force:<note place="margin">That the wood of roots muſt not bee caſt away in deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> for that which produceth the ſeede, that onely contayneth the whole vertue thereof, becauſe it alone hath life. That part then which is of wood, ſeemeth to be the chiefe and principall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the medicine: becauſe that that thing onely which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, produceth the ſeed, &amp; in that part only wherein it hath life. For although that in ſuccorie, and ſuch like herbes, ſome leaues grow out of the barke: yet the herbe it ſelfe, and the ſeed doe proceed out of the wood. As the leaues then are in the ſtalke or ſlip; ſo is the barke in the wood: and both leaues and barke are therein for ſafegard thereof. In the lower part the iuice falleth into the roote: by the middle part the roote is nouriſhed, and in the vppermoſt part it is conuerted into ſeed. Wherefore the vppermoſt part of the roote is beſt, and moſt different from the nature of earth. The flowers likewiſe haue their parts; for there is a kinde of leafe in the flower which alwaies ſhineth, and is in all flowers, becauſe it is made of a verie fine ſubſtance. The buddes likewiſe wherein the flowers are contayned are parts of them; and the ſeede of which the flower ſpringeth, as it is cauſe of the generation thereof; ſo is it a part of the flower,<note place="margin">What plants and what parts of them haue the greateſt virtue.</note> and ſo is the ſtalke or foote, called <hi>(Pediculus)</hi> in which all theſe things are as it were planted and adioyned thereto. Let vs alſo note, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt trees the old are of more ſubtile qualitie then the other. And euerie tree, which beareth leaues all the yeere long, is hot and drie (as the palme tree, the oliue tree, the cedar, the myrtle.) But this reaſon is not auaileable in herbes: for houſeleeke is of a groſſe ſubſtance, and yet beareth leaues all winter. And indeed both in herbes and trees they which grow wilde abroad are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the domeſticall: and ſo are they which are odoriferous, much more then they which haue a badde ſauour, and haue no ſent at all, eſpecially if they grow in mountaines: and therefore they are preferred by phiſitions before the other. And we muſt note, that moſt commonly the roots ſmell better, and are ſweeter then the other parts of the plant, except the flowers, which is ſo becauſe the concoction is beſt done in the rootes. For all things, which haue the humour well boiled, ſmell beſt: for that humour is moſt ſubtile and cloſe. For which cauſe, all flowers almoſt doe ſmell well. For by reaſon that the humour which is in them is verie ſubtile and little, it is the more eaſily concocted
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:8737:163"/>
therein: and therefore alſo it ſooner periſheth. But this humour remayneth, and is preſerued in the rootes and in the ſtocke; for the ſubtile ſubſtance thereof being well concocted, doth abide in the earthie ſubſtance,<note place="margin">Why young folkes breth is ſweeter then that of the old.</note> whereby we may learne why yoong folks haue ſweeter breath then olde and diſtempered people. For children haue their humour verie ſubtile, and the ſmall humour may be verie well concocted in yoong folkes, by the great heat which aboundeth in them. But want of heat hindreth it in olde folkes, and the qualitie of the humour is hurt in thoſe that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, &amp; cauſeth that the decoction cannot be performed. Now we haue ſtaide long enough in this diſcourſe: But as we haue diſtinguiſhed plants into fower principall kindes, let vs now ſpeake of the nature and propertie of the moſt eſpeciall among them; to the ende that according to our intention we may not paſſe ouer any of the workes of God, without producing ſome teſtimonies, which may cauſe vs more and more to celebrate his diuine prouidence.

And therefore amongſt thoſe trees that are tranſported from one place to another; ſome do beare fruit (as the Palmes at Genoa) ſome alſo beare, but vnperfectly (as the Pepper-tree at Millaine.) There are ſome that cannot grow, (as the wood of Aloës brought out of India into Italy:) And ſome beare perfect fruit, bicauſe they can agree with the aire, and with the ſoile as well of one countrey as of another (as the Vines tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported out of Spaine into India.) But aboue all, the calmenes of the aire, and the anſwerablenes of the place are of great efficacy in the naturall propertie of trees, &amp; do often cauſe them to beare great quantity of fruit and bloſſomes, and are the cauſe that ſome are alwaies greene. And therefore about the Grand Cairo, and in the countrey of Elephants, the leaues do neuer fall off the fig-trees and vines: and in the Iſles and other regions of the weſt
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:8737:163"/>
Indies diſcouered by the Spaniards, there is neuer a tree, but is alwaies greene. And therefore there are diuers trees, both of one, and of diuers kindes alſo, higher, greener, and fairer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in one place then in another. For in hot and moiſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries all plants grow greater, fuller of iuice, and greener,<note place="margin">Property of the plants accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where they growe.</note> if the proper nature of the plant doe not hinder: and in hot and drie places they are ſmaller and drier, and yet of no leſſe vertue: But in moiſt and cold regions, the plants are weake and full of ſappe. And they, which are hot by nature grow broad and high; but the cold are ſmall. Now all trees, whereof we now particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, do by nature grow greatly for the moſt part, and flouriſh a verie long time. As <hi>Ioſephus</hi> recordeth, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Oke did yet ſtand in his daies: And there were betwixt the deſtruction of Hieruſalem and the death of <hi>Abraham,</hi> two thouſand yeeres. And next to the oke, the palme, the beech, the oliue-tree, the elme, and the pine-tree do flouriſh longeſt.</p>
                  <p>Now will I proceede to a particular deſcription of ſome trees, the moſt woorthie to bee conſidered of:<note place="margin">Of the pine.</note> amongſt which the Pine chalengeth the firſt place: whereof there are two kindes: one is domeſticall, and the other ſauage. The domeſticall kinde hath an infinite ſort of branches vpon the verie vppermoſt toppe of the ſtocke, which ſpread rounde about it, being very thicke of leaues, which are pointed in the end, and long; it beareth plentie of great and ſounde apples, wherein are certaine hard kernels incloſed, as blacke as ſoote, in which the fruite is founde, being couered with a thinne yellow skinne, eaſie to get off, by pilling it with your fingers. And this fruite is ſweete and pleaſant in taſte, of a fatte and oylie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For the ſauage or wilde one, there are many ſorts of them. Some growe on mountaines, others on the ſea coaſt. They of the mountaines are of three kindes. For there are ſome that be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all the reſt, which abound in the forreſts of Bohemia, Sila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Polonia, and other places, whereof the countrey men make pitch. Which are euery whit like to the domeſticall ſort, ſauing that their apples bee leſſe: for they bee not much greater then thoſe of Cypreſſe, but they are a little longer, and more ſounde, and husked like thoſe of the domeſticall Pine, being full of gumme, and of a ſweete ſent. The ſecond kinde of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Pines are ſuch as haue no ſtocke or trunke, but ſprout their branches out of their roote cloſe to the earth, running along the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:8737:164"/>
ground till they attaine to tenne or fifteene cubits length: they beare fruite like vnto the other, but of a bigger ſiſe, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of gumme; and are founde in many places of Italy. Finallie there are many other which are of goodly height, and yet not ſo high as thoſe of the firſt kinde, neither haue they the barke of their ſtocks yellow like the other pines: likewiſe their fruite is ſomewhat enclining towards red, but more brittle then all the reſt. And the kernels of them are three ſquare and crooked, and in taſte ſomewhat like thoſe of the garden pine, ſauing that they leaue a certaine quicke ſharpenes in the mouth (which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to all wilde trees) and they abounde in the territorie of Trent. And the gumme that proceeds out of all theſe ſorts of pines, is white and ſweete. The ſea pines are of two ſorts, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring onely in the greatnes and ſmalneſſe of their fruite: and do all of them produce white odoriferous gumme, which turneth into a thinne liquor,<note place="margin">Qualities, and virtues of the pine kernels.</note> whereof men make black pitch. Moreouer, as concerning the fruite of the pine in generall; it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that therein are many great vertues &amp; properties, and that it is very profitable for mans bodie. For it is of a moderate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, but that it enclineth more towards heate. It ripeneth, it mollifieth, it reſolueth, it fatneth, and it nouriſheth well. It cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth the humours, which are corrupted in the intrailes; neuertheleſſe it is hard in digeſtion: and therefore to ſuch as are cold of nature, the kernels are miniſtred with honie; &amp; to ſuch as are hot, with ſugar, to correct the ſtrength of thoſe kernels. They do helpe (being often eaten) the paines of the ſinewes, and are good for thoſe that be troubled with the Sciatica, palſie, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and numbnes of members. They clenſe the lungs and the corruption of them, purging out all clammie hummors and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennes. They are profitable againſt the cough, and the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the reines and bladder: wherefore they eaſe them much who piſſe but drop by drop, and feele their vrine burne. They fatten leane folkes, and being taken with the iuice of purſlaine, they doe helpe eruptions of the ſtomacke.

And the water of thoſe apples ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie greene, being diſtilled through a limbecke doth waſh out the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:8737:164"/>
wrinckles of the face. Moreouer of the oldeſt pines is pitch made, which is called Nauall, by reaſon that it is very good to pitch ſhips: which to do men cut downe the pines with an hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet which are become full of gummie iuice, and hewe them in peeces, as they doe other trees to make coales of. Whereupon let vs note, that they which inhabite mountaines ſay, that it is a maladie amongſt pines, when not onely the hart thereof, but the outward part of the ſtocke doth conuert into a gummie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: which hapneth to them through great abundance of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which cauſeth them to die, euen as too much fatte ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth liuing creatures. And out of this gummie woode is pitch, by woondrous skill extracted, and the oile and foote are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which haue diuers properties in medicines.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now ſpeake of the Firre-tree,<note place="margin">Of the firre-tree, and of the roſin which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.</note> which groweth vprigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all the trees, and therefore is very fitte to emploie in all workes: There are ſuch high ones, that in Sweden ſome are ſeene of an hundred foote in length, and that of ſome, which are ſtraight and of a like thicknes euery where without knots, men may make worke of an hundred and ten foote long. This tree beareth fruite of a ſpanne long, compoſed of certaine ſcales, being one compiled vpon another, vnder which the white ſeede is included, without any iuice in them. It produceth an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite liquor and gumme betwixt two barkes, which is called in vulgar Italian <hi>(Lagrimo)</hi> that is, the Teare of the Firre-tree, and it runneth vnder the firſt barke, which being opened, lies like the matter of an old impoſtume. This gumme is liquid, of a very good ſmell, and ſomewhat ſharpe in taſte. It is very good for greene wounds, not onely bicauſe it ſearcheth them, but alſo bicauſe it is mundificatiue and incarnatiue. Being aſſumed in drinke, it clenſeth the reines of grauell, and doth much aſſwage the paines of the goute, and of the ſciatica. It healeth maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly well all wounds of the head, ſo that no other thing be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thereto.</p>
                  <p>The Cypreſſe is likewiſe rich in beautie and in properties:<note place="margin">Of the cypreſſe tree, and the properties thereof.</note> of which trees there are male and female: the female growes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies pointed towards the top, and the male hath his branches ſpred abroad. Each of them is a very high tree, ſtraight, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring branches onely in the toppe thereof. And this tree is drieſt of all others, hauing the humor very fat, and well digeſted. And therefore it agreeth not with dung and excrements, and waxeth
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:8737:165"/>
drie neere to waters. The wood thereof is odoriferous, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the ſent by oldnes, neither is eaten with wormes, nor doth rot through any fault: but the leaues of this tree beaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to powder, and ſtrowed amongſt apparell, or with the ſeede, do defend them that wormes cannot annoy them. It beareth fruite three times a yeere, which is hard and ſound, containing the ſeed within. It caſteth out of the ſtocke ſome gum, but very little, like vnto Turpentine, and almoſt of the ſame nature. This tree is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common in Italie. But the right and naturall countrie thereof is the iſle of Candie: for in what place ſoeuer the ground be there remooued and tilled, if nothing elſe be ſowen therein, the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe will preſently ſpring vp of it ſelfe. The decoction of their nuts made in ſtrong vineger, aſſwageth the paine of the teeth, if the mouth be often waſhed therewith. So much doth the decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the leaues. Which nuts being ſtamped and drunke with old wine, appeaſe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ough. They are very good, and the leaues alſo, to ſearch great wounds in tough bodies. Whereby it appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that this tree hath the vertue to drie vp, without much ſharpnes and heate, as the taſte doth teſtifie. For one ſhall taſte therein very little ſharpnes, much bitterneſſe, and more ſower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the cedar, and of the gum thereof.</note>The Cedar alſo is a tree that groweth very big, and beareth fruit almoſt like to that of the Cypreſſe tree, but a little bigger. There be ſome that beare no fruit although that they bud. And that which beareth fruit buddeth not, and the new fruit appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thereupon before the old is perfectly ripe. Out of this tree runneth an excellent white and liquid gum, which in time is by heate of the ſunne congealed into graines. In Syria, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in mount Libanon the Cedars grow very high, and in great plentie, and are very like to Firre-trees. Their branches from the bottome to the top, are almoſt ſpread and placed rounde about it, in faſhion like the ſpokes of a wheele, and the higheſt are euermore ſhorteſt. Wherefore this tree a far off ſeemeth to repreſent the figure of a Pyramis. The hart or pith of the Cedar is very hard, ſweete, and red: wherefore the ancients ſuppoſed, that the wood could not weare, nor become worme-eaten: but would endure for euer. So <hi>Salomon</hi> cauſed the holy temple of God in Ieruſalem to be builded thereof: and the pagans made their ſtatues of it, thinking it would endure as long as marble or braſſe. Some ſay that the greateſt which was euer ſeene, was hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:8737:165"/>
in Cypreſſe to make the gallie of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> which had eleuen oares vpon a ſide. For it was one hundred and thirtie foote long, and as thicke as three men might fadome. There are alſo in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of Greece, two kindes of ſmall Cedars, which are like to the Iuniper tree. Now all Cedars are of nature hot and drie in the third degree: And the oile, which is made of their gum approcheth to the fourth degree, and is very ſubtile. Wherefore it doth eaſily and without paine rot ſoft and delicate fleſh: but in hard bodies it operateth with more time &amp; difficultie. It drieth dead bodies, and preſerueth them from putrifaction, by conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſuperfluous humors, without touching the ſound parts: but in liuing bodies, the heate which conſiſteth in them, doth augment the forces of this oile, which cauſeth it to burne the tender fleſh. Wherefore hauing ſuch vertue, it is no maruell if it kill nits, lice, wormes, and vermine in the eares: and if being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it killeth the childe in the mothers wombe, and being dead doth void it out, with many other effects which phiſitions attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto it.

                  <p>THe loue of ones natiue ſoile hath a maruellous power in all things: for nature produceth in ſome places ſuch ſtubborne plants, that for any endeuor and paines, which one may take with them, yet can they not be retained or kept but in their owne proper ground. Many great perſonages both in France and in Italie haue taken paines to tame them, and cauſe them to growe in gardens, orchards, and other moſt pleaſant places, as any in the world. But as ruſticall mountainers deſpiſe the delights and gallantnes of cities, and eſteeme not of ciuilitie and honeſtie of manners, not being able to liue any where at eaſe and pleaſure but in their owne cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: ſo it ſeemeth that many plants, which are brought amongſt vs, and husbanded with great care and labour, deſpiſing the ſweetnes of the aire, the beautie of gardens, the pleaſant watring of fountaines, and the goodly companie of infinite herbs and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:8737:166"/>
trees already made familiar, haue at laſt retired into their owne deſerts and wilderneſſes, and into the place of their originall. Now of the number of theſe is the Cinamon, which though that whiles Rome flouriſhed (as many authors record) it was planted in diuers places, yet now is there not any of it to bee founde throughout Italie, nay in all Europe. But Aſia aboundeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in many places, yea ſo doth Arabia foelix in diuers parts, and much more India, eſpecially in one iſland called Monorique, the mountaines whereof beare plentie of Cinamon-trees.</p>

And certaine moneths of the yeere he cauſeth ſome twigges and ſyons to be cut, the ſmalleſt and fineſt that may bee in the tree, and the barke of them to be peeled off, which is ſold very deere to ſuch ſtrangers as trafficke therein. For this is the beſt of the tree. But the Cinamon which is brought hither, is nothing elſe but the ſecond barke, that is peeled off, which being cut with a little knife, rowleth vp togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Propertie of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon.</note> and changeth colour. Moreouer the propertie of Cinamon is to dry and heate to the third degree: for it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of very ſubtile partes, and is very ſharpe in taſte, and of a certaine quicke aſtriction: by means whereof it taketh away and diſſolueth the ſuperfluities of the body, &amp; fortifieth the members. There is a diſtilled water made of Cinamon, which is ſtrong in ſmell and taſte, and is of great vertue. For take a pound of Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, braie it, and put it into a veſſell with fower pound of Roſe-water, and halfe a pound of white wine: then ſet your veſſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very cloſe ſtopped, in warme water, and then make your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation in the ſame water, being placed vpon a furnace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the fire is temperately maintained, in ſuch ſort that the ſaide warme water do alwaies boile. And this diſtilled water is verie ſoueraigne againſt all diſeaſes that come through colde, for it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth and conſumeth fleame and clammie humors, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away all windines. It doth eſpecially comfort the ſtomack,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8737:166"/>
the liuer, the ſpleene, the braine, and the ſinewes. It is a ſingular and preſent remedie againſt faintneſſe of the hart, againſt paines and prickings of the mouth and ſtomacke: it reſiſteth poiſons, and bitings of venemous beaſts; it prouoketh vrine, and the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in women: It is good for thoſe that haue ſhort breath, that are ſicke of the palſie, or haue the falling ſicknes. And in a word, when neede is to heat, to open, to pierce, to reſolue, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; this water is very profitable therefore.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſpeake of the tree that beareth Caſſia.<note place="margin">Of the tree bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring caſſia.</note> For it is in the number of the greateſt and moſt ſingular trees. The woode thereof is maſſiue, cloſe, of the colour of boxe neere the barke, and blacke in the midſt like Ebonie. When it is greene, it hath a bad ſmell, but this ſauour doth weare away being drie. It bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth certaine cods, which hang vpon the branches verie long, round, and maſſiue, which being ripe, waxe blacke and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reddiſh. And they are full of a ſoft and blacke ſappe, like to thicke creame, not ſticking altogither like marrow in a bone, but is contained as it were in little caſes, being one ſeparated from another by thinne skins ſet very cloſe togither: betwixt euery one of which there is a very hard graine. In Egypt and in India are very many of theſe Caſſia trees, and in the iſle of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probana. Their cods are not very great, but cleare, heauie, and verie full: in ſuch ſort, that if they be ſhaken, one cannot heare the graines rattle therein, and theſe are the beſt. The ſappe or iuice of them is hot and moiſt in the thirde degree.<note place="margin">Property of the caſſia.</note> It is lenitiue and looſening, and purifieth the bloud. It ſtancheth heat of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and doth moderately looſen the belly. It is marueilous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for thoſe that cannot make water, eſpecially if it be vſed with medicines that prouoke vrine. It purgeth choler and fleame, and mollifieth the breaſt and the throate, and reſolueth inflammations therein: it clenſeth the raines from grauell and ſand, if it bee drunke with the decoction of licor as and other ſimples fit to prouoke vrine: and if it be often taken, it hindreth the ſtone in the raines. Beſides all this, it is good againſt hotte agues, and being outwardly applied, it aſſwageth inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt aromaticall trees, the tree that beareth frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe is woorthie to be conſidered of.<note place="margin">Of the franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe tree.</note> The forme thereof is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like to a pine, and out of it runs a liquor, that afterwardes waxeth hard, which we call frankincenſe: whereof there are two
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:8737:167"/>
ſorts. One ſort is gathered in ſommer in the dogge-daies, in the greateſt burning heate of the yeere, at which time the barke is ſplit, being then fulleſt of moiſture. And this frankincenſe is whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, tranſparent and pure. The other kinde is gathered in the Spring time, by meanes of another inciſion, which is made in this tree in winter, and it is ſomewhat redde, approching nothing neere either in goodnes or value, or elſe in waight or vertue to the firſt. Arabia hath many forreſts wherein frankincenſe is found. And the inhabitants of the countrey do lance the trees with a knife to cauſe them diſtill gumme the better, or elſe the liquor whereof it is made:<note place="margin">Propertie of franckincenſe.</note> amongſt which trees there are ſome, that may yeeld aboue threeſcore pounds euery yeere. Moreouer being taken in drinke it is very good againſt Dyſenterias and fluxes of the bellie. It encreaſeth the memorie, chaſeth awaie ſadnes, reioiceth the hart, &amp; is profitable for all the paſſions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. It alſo ſtaieth the bleeding at noſe, being incorporated with the white of an egge and aloes, and put into the noſthrils in a tent. It likewiſe appeaſeth the paines of the megrim, being mixed with myrrh and glaire of an egge, and applied to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and temples. It is alſo hot in the ſecond degree, and drie in the firſt, and hath ſome aſtriction, which is but little founde in that which is white.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the tree that beares mirrh.</note>Let vs ſpeake of myrrhe, which groweth abundantly in the ſame regions where frankincenſe doth. The tree which beareth it is full of prickles in ſome places, being of fiue or ſixe cubites high, very hard and crooked, and thicker then the frankincenſe tree, the barke ſmooth like a laurell tree, and the leaues like thoſe of the oliue tree, but rougher, hauing certaine ſharpe prickles at the end. Out of this tree there diſtilleth a gummie liquor like teares, which hardneth by little and little, and is of colour ſomewhat greene, and is cleere and ſweete, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vnpleaſant in taſte through bitternes. Whereby it appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the myrrh which heere we haue is not right, for all theſe markes are not found therein, but it is blacke, and as if it were ſcorched, mouldie and moſſie on the outſide. Which wee neede not thinke ſtrange, conſidering that euen in Alexandria, where our men do commonly buie myrrh, there is ſcarce any to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten which is not ſophiſticate. For the Arabian Mahumetans, who bring it thither, and ſell it, doe therein vſe a thouſand deceits, mocking at ſuch Chriſtians as traffike with them, and at their
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:8737:167"/>
curioſitie. There is great difference then betwixt natural myrrh, which diſtilleth out of the tree; and artificiall being ſophiſticated with gum, and mixed with other things,<note place="margin">Propertie of mirrh.</note> ſuch as is ordinarie in our Apothecaries ſhops. Now the right myrrh is of hot and drie qualitie in the ſecond degree: and being drunke, it is verie profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for thoſe that haue the quartaine ague. It is vſed in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes againſt poiſons, againſt hurts by venemous beaſts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the plague. And being applied to wounds in the head, it will heale them.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now ſpeake of the tree that beareth cloues,<note place="margin">Of the Cloue-tree.</note> which gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in the ſoutheaſt countries in certaine iſles of the Indian ſea. The ſtocke thereof is like to that of a boxe tree, and ſo is the wood. It flouriſheth almoſt like to a laurell-tree, and the fruit groweth in this manner. At the ende of euerie little branch there doth firſt appeere a budde, which produceth a flower or bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of purple colour, afterwards by little &amp; little the fruit is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and commeth to that paſſe, as we behold it, being red when it groweth out of the bloome: but by heat of the Sunne it wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth blacke afterwards in ſuch ſort as it is brought hither. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the countrey, eſpecially of the Iſles of Molucca, doe plant and ſet cloue-trees almoſt in the ſame manner, as we in Europe do our vines. And that they may preſerue this fruit and ſpice a long time; they make pits in the earth, wherein they put the cloues, till ſuch time as merchants come to carry them away. This tree is full of branches, and beareth many bloſſomes white at firſt, afterwards greene, and at laſt red. The people there ſhake and beat the vppermoſt boughes of the tree hauing firſt made cleane the place vnderneath: for no herbe groweth neere about it, becauſe it draweth all the moiſture of the earth to it ſelfe. And the cloues ſo ſhaken downe are put to dry two or three daies, and are then ſhut vp till they be ſold. That cloue which ſticketh ſtill faſt to the tree, doth waxe great; yet differeth not from the reſt, except in oldnes: though ſome haue held opinion that the greateſt are of the male kinde. This tree ſpringeth of it ſelfe, out of one onely corne of a cloue, which hath fallen on the ground, and it indureth an hundred yeeres, as the inhabitants report. The vertue of cloues is verie great. For they are good for the liuer,<note place="margin">Of the property of Cloues.</note> the ſtomacke, and the heart. They helpe digeſtion, and binde the fluxe of the belly. They cleere the ſight, conſume and take away the webbe, and cloudes in the eies. They heat and drie to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:8737:168"/>
the third degree: they ſtrengthen and open both together, and are verie piercing. Being beaten to powder and drunke with wine, or the iuice of Quinces, they ſtay vomitings; cauſe loſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to returne; fortifie the ſtomacke and the head. They heat verie well a cold liuer. And for this cauſe they are miniſtred verie profitably to ſuch as haue the dropſie, eſpecially to thoſe, who haue water ſpread throughout all their bodie. The ſmell of them fetcheth thoſe againe that haue ſwouned, and being chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſweeten the breath. They are good for ſuch as are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the falling ſicknes, with the palſie, and with the lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. Being eaten or taken in perfume, they preſerue from the plague, and are verie commodious for ſuch as are ſubiect to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhes, and for ſuch as are ſtuffed in the noſe, if they receiue the ſmoke thereof into their noſthrils. In briefe their vſe is infinitely diuers &amp; profitable, both in phiſicke and in our ordinarie diet, whereby we reſtore nature. And ſith we are in this talke, let it be your part (AMANA) to entreat of other trees bearing ſpices.</p>

Now they who haue trauelled into India make great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,<note place="margin">Of the Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megge tree.</note> that the trees which beare Nutmegs, do abundantly grow in an Iſle named (Banda) and in many other Iſles of the Moluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes: and that it is as great, and as long branched as a walnut-tree with vs: and that there is but ſmall difference in the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nutmegs, and of common nuts. Moreouer, this fruit is at firſt couered with two barks, whereof the outtermoſt is hairie or moſſie, vnder which is a thinne bloome, which like a net or fillet doth embrace and couer the nut, &amp; is like a skaule or coife called <hi>(Mace)</hi> whereof there is great account made, and it is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt the moſt pretious and rareſt ſpices: which we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee in thoſe nutmegs that are brought whole from the Indies,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:8737:168"/>
being preſerued in ſugar or in iuice of carrouges. The other bark which couereth the nutmeg is like the ſhell of an haſell nut, out of which they take it to bring vnto vs, which is verie eaſie to doe by reaſon that the time of ripening being come, this hard ſhell openeth and ſheweth an inward rinde that enuironeth the nut about, which we call as aforeſaid Mace: which at that time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth as red as skarlet; but when the nut is drie, it turnes yellowiſh, &amp; is thriſe as deere as the nuts themſelues. That which is more to be admired in this tree, is, that it beareth the fruit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being ſo excellent, naturally without any induſtrie or husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie of man. Moreouer, the beſt nuts are the neweſt (not rotten) the heauieſt, fulleſt, moſt oylie, &amp; abounding in moiſture, ſo that if one thruſt a needle thereinto, there doth preſently ſome iuice iſſue. They are hot and drie in the ſecond degree and reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.

They cleere the ſight, ſtrengthen the ſtomacke and liuer; abate the ſwelling of the ſpleene, prouoke vrine, ſtay the fluxe of the bellie, driue away ventoſitie, and are maruellous good againſt cold diſeaſes in the wombe. In ſumme, they haue the ſame vertues that Cloues haue. And when they are greene or new, being bruiſed and well heated in a veſſell, and then put into a preſſe, there iſſueth a licour, which being cold, is congealed like to new waxe, and ſmelleth paſſing ſweete, and is very excellent for olde griefes of the ſinewes and ioints engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred through cold.</p>
                  <p>Now ſpeake we of Ginger and other ſpices,<note place="margin">Of Ginger.</note> which for the moſt part growe in the ſame regions of Aſia, and eſpecially in the Indies, and Molucca-iſles, where Nutmegs abound. In them there is great quantitie of Ginger, which is a roote, not of ſuch a plant as may properly be called a tree, but rather an herbe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it groweth not very high, but beareth leaues like a cane or reede, which doe wax greene twiſe or thriſe a yeere. This roote is very knottie, and not aboue three or fower ſpans deepe in the ground, and ſometimes ſo big, that it waigheth a pound. They that dig vp theſe rootes, do alwaies leaue a ſpace between two knots in the pit, and couer it againe with earth as being the ſeede of this plant, to receiue the fruit thereof the next enſuing yeere, that is the rootes, which ſhall be newly ſprouted. In Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut the greene Ginger is ſteeped and conſerued in ſugar, or in a kinde of honie that is taken out of certaine cods or husks, and is
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:8737:169"/>
conuaied into Italie, where it is much more eſteemed then that of Venice. For that which is there is made of dry roots artificially mollified,<note place="margin">Propertie of Ginger.</note> and which want much of their vertue and power. Moreouer Ginger is very profitable: For it helpeth digeſtion, it looſeneth the belly moderately, it is good for the ſtomacke, and profitable againſt all things that may dim, or blinde the ſight. It heateth much, not at firſt taſting like pepper. For which cauſe we may not thinke it to conſiſt of ſo ſubtile parts: the heat would elſe preſently declare it ſelfe, and it would ſuddenly become hot in act. Wherupon Ginger is knowne to be compoſed of a groſſe and indigeſted ſubſtance, not drie and earthie, but moiſt and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which is the cauſe that it doth eaſily corrupt and rot, to wit, by reaſon of the ſuperfluous moiſture thereof. For ſuch things as are very drie, or moiſtned by a digeſted, naturall, and moderate humiditie, are not ſubiect to corruption and rottenneſſe. Thence alſo it proceedeth, that the heate which commeth of Ginger doth endure longer then that of pepper. For as drie ſtubble is ſoone on fire, and ſoone burnt out: euen ſo is the heate that proceedeth from ſimples, and drie drugs. But that which iſſueth from moiſt ones, as out of greene wood, doth inflame ſlowlier, and endure longer.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of Pepper and the diuers kinds thereof.</note>Pepper doth grow abundantly in the Indies, &amp; eſpecially in the two iſles called (the greater, &amp; leſſer Iaua) It doth grow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> little trees, the leaues whereof reſemble much the leaues of a Citron-tree, the fruit whereof is no greater then a ball. And according to the diuers places where Pepper groweth, it is different in kinde: yea in one place there are diuers ſorts, and chiefly round &amp; long Pepper. Now in ſome iſles (as alongſt the riuer Ganabara) when the inhabitants plant Pepper, they burie the roote thereof neere to ſome other fruit trees, and oftentimes neere to yoong palmes or date trees, vpon the top whereof the twigs or ſyons doe at length growe. Which the rods and ſmall branches puld from pepper trees doe likewiſe, being planted with the ſame trees, which they imbrace running to the very top of them: where the pepper hangs in cluſters, like the grapes of a wilde vine, but clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and thicker. And when it is ripe they gather it, and lay it in the ſunne to drie vpon lattiſes made of palme trees, till ſuch time as it become blacke and wrinkled, which is commonly done in three daies. And this pepper is round. But the trees that beare long pepper do differ from the reſt eſpecially in leaues and fruit:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:8737:169"/>
For the leaues are ſharper at the end, and the pepper hangeth vpon the tree like cluſters of nuts, made and heaped with many little graines. There is yet another kinde of pepper, called (E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian pepper) or (pepper of the Negros) which groweth in cods like beanes, or peaſe: and the graines thereof are a little leſſe then thoſe of blacke pepper. Moreouer all pepper is hot in the fourth degree, and therefore it burneth and bliſtereth the bodie, ſo that the vſe thereof cannot but be dangerous, though it haue many ſecret properties againſt the quiuerings and ſhakings that accompanie feuers, which vſually come to one; and againſt the cough, and all maladies of the breaſt. There is alſo a kinde of watrie pepper, which groweth neere to ſlowe waters, that runne but ſoftly. The ſtalke thereof is knottie, maſſiue, hauing many pits, out of which the branches doe growe. The leaues of it are like to mints, ſauing that they be greater, ſofter, and whiter. The ſeede is ſharpe and ſtrong, and groweth vpon little twigs neere to the leaues in manner of grapes. It is ſo named of the places where it groweth, and the likenes of taſte, which it hath with common pepper. But we haue ſpoken ynough concerning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Let vs now conſider of other moſt rare and ſingular trees, the woonder whereof declareth the author of nature to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding admirable, as we may note (ARAM) by your diſcourſe.</p>

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:8737:170"/>
hath engrauen images of himſelfe in euery work of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie. Now among ſuch trees as they haue written of, and which (as mee ſeemeth) are worthie of greateſt admiration, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee not altogither ſo rare as many others, the Date-trees require place, which are very common in Arabia, Egypt, and almoſt in all parts of Africa, and in Iudaea, as likewiſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iſles of Greece, and regions of Europe (where they beare no fruit,<note place="margin">Of the Date-tree.</note> which is not ſo throughout all Africa) for the Palmes, or Date-trees beare in many places a ſweete, pleaſant and very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate fruit to eat, and this tree is very high, and hath the ſtock thereof very hard, bearing no branches but round about the top, with the ends of them hanging downe to the ground-wards. It buddeth forth many bloſſomes, hanging at certaine fine ſmall ſtalkes, cluſtred togither in figure like to cluſters of ſaffron, but much leſſe, and white: and of thoſe are formed reddiſh Dates, which haue a very hard, long, and creſted ſtone within them. And there are of theſe trees male and female; which are diſcerned, in that the femall buddeth without bloſſomes,<note place="margin">Maruell of the female Palme-tree.</note> or flowers. And that which is moſt admirable in this diuerſitie of kinde, is, that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male beeing ſeparated from the male, will hang downe hir bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and wither, turning hir ſelfe that way, whither her male hath beene caried: ſo that the inhabitants of the countrie fearing to looſe hir, take of the earth and of the root of the male, which they lay about the foot of the female, who through this meanes ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, reneweth ſtrength, and beareth fruit. It is noted in Date-trees that there are ſome, which naturally follow the Sun, which way ſo euer he turneth, as many other plants do, which hauing a ſympathy and ſecret inclination to this ſtar, as acknowledging his virtue, and that their vigour is deriued from him, do alwaies behold him, they themſelues looſing colour, when hee is far off from them. And this is alſo very wonderfull in the Date tree, that beeing dead, it reuiueth of it ſelfe, by meanes of the proper rootes thereof, which beeing (very deepe vnder ground) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the radicall humour, there do at length ſpring out of them certaine ſtalkes, which are afterwards ſuſtained by the Sun, there nouriſhed and made trees,<note place="margin">Drinke that diſtilleth out of the Date-tree.</note> bearing fruit as before. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer out of the trunck of Date-trees, many people (eſpecially the Negroes) do extract a licour (which they vſe for beuerage in ſtead of wine) by making a large ſlit therein with a certaine inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a foot or two aboue the earth. And this licour is of the colour
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:8737:170"/>
of whay, very good to drinke, and almoſt aſmuch inebriating or as ſtrong as wine, for which cauſe, it muſt bee very oftentimes mixed with water. And when it runneth out of the ſtock, it is as ſweete as new wine: but it looſeth that ſweetenes from day to day, becomming more pleaſant to drinke, when it taſteth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more tart, becauſe it doth then ſlake thirſt beſt. They alſo draw out of this tree certaine threeds as fine as our threed,<note place="margin">Tapiſtry made of Palme trees.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they make tapiſtrie worke, which ſerue like other things to couer them: which neede not ſeeme verie ſtrange, conſidering that in many other places they beat the barkes of ſome trees ſo hard (after they haue wet it) that they do draw it out ſo fine, and weaue it ſo artificially, as one would ſuppoſe it to be ſome faire and thin taffata. Such as haue ſailed to Manicongo, and along the coaſt of Ethiopia, do aſſure vs thereof in their writings. For if that cotton commeth from trees, and ſilke is ſpunne by wormes (as all men know) what ſhould hinder the foreſaid things to be of ſuch ability through the ordinance of God eſtabliſhed in nature, to the end that men might receiue from theſe plants, that which is needfull for them, and which they cannot obtaine by the meanes that are common to others? But if any make doubt therof, becauſe it is not notoriouſly known vnto all, then muſt we ſhut the doore againſt al things that ſeeme rare. But what ſhal we ſay to that, which is taught vs by many graue Authors, that of the fruit of theſe trees, called (the Thebane Date) being dried in the ſun, til ſuch time as it may be ready to be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<note place="margin">Bread made of Dates.</note> men vſe to make bread, which is a common practiſe amongſt thoſe of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey? Moreouer, for the particular vertues and properties of Dates, they are ſo much different,<note place="margin">Propertie of Dates.</note> as there bee diuers kindes of them: for ſome are drie and binding (as thoſe of Egypt) others are ſoft, moiſt, and ſweete (as thoſe that grow in Syria, Paleſtina, and Iericho.) And the reſt are in meane betwixt theſe two kinds: and all are hard in digeſtion, and breed headach. Some ſay that two greene dates (hauing their ſtones taken out, and then filled vp with powder of Vermilion) being eaten, doe keepe women with child that they may not abort: and that being dried they be good to eate by ſuch as ſpit blood, to ſuch as haue a weake ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and are troubled with the bloodie fluxe.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſpeake of a tree,<note place="margin">Of a tree ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for bread, oyle, wine, and vineger.</note> that doth much reſemble the Date-tree, and is no leſſe woorthie of woonder then it, becauſe it ſerueth for bread, wine, oyle, and vineger. This tree is called by
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:8737:171"/>
the Arabians <hi>(Baratha)</hi> and of ſome <hi>(Ianſialindi)</hi> which is as much to ſay, as, the Indian tree, and the Indians name it <hi>(Trican)</hi> and the fruit thereof <hi>(Nihor)</hi> or <hi>Cocco.</hi> It is found in many Ilands of India, chiefly in Zamat, and in the circumiacent Iſles, where the people liue vpon the fruit of this tree, which fruit is as big as a mans head: and is that, which we terme (An Indie Nut.) The outtermoſt barke of this tree is all greene, and aboue two fingers thicke: amongſt which they finde certaine fillets, whereof they make cords, wherewith the inhabitants of the countrey ſowe their boats together. Within this barke is another, which they burne and beat to duſt: afterwards they vſe this powder as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for their ſicke. Vnder this ſecond barke againe is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine white pith couered, which is about a finger thicke, and this they eate in ſtead of bread, with fleſh and fiſh. And to make it the better, they dry it firſt, and then bring it into meale, and make verie good bread thereof, as the ancients in old time made of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes and of cheſtnuts, for want of corne. In the midſt of this pith they finde a verie cleere, ſweete, and cordiall water, which being curdled, and conuerted into an oylie ſubſtance, they boyle it, and then this mixture becomes ſo fat, as the beſt butter that can be made amongſt vs. But if they would haue vineger, they ſet this water in the ſunne without making it to boyle, and it will become cleere and ſharpe, and as white as milke. For their drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king liquor, it runs out of the branches in great abundance. And two of theſe trees ſuffice for the nouriſhment of an whole family. Furthermore, their fruit is hot in the ſecond degree, and moiſt in the firſt.<note place="margin">Propertie of Indie Nuts.</note> There is oyle drawen out of it verie good againſt the hemorrhoides, and which healeth the paines of the reines and of the knees, and purgeth the bellie of wormes.

The barke is all yealow, and the fruit big and round like a ball, hauing a nut encloſed within it, wherein is found a meruailous bitter kernell: the taſt whereof vpon the toung doth neere approach to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Angelica-roote; the fruit is very good to ſtaunch thirſt, the kernell (for all it is ſo bitter) doth much ſurpaſſe it in ſweetenes

through the excellency thereof. For they of the country do make an oyle, which they keepe carefully, becauſe it is very good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the paine of the liuer, and ſpleene, whether it be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or outwardly applied to the diſeaſed part. They keepe them alſo from the crampe. This tree likewiſe yeeldeth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine gum, whereof they vſe plaiſters againſt all paines of their members.</p>
                  <p>But amongſt many ſingular trees, found out in our daies in the South in the wilde country, that is one, which doth ſerue to die with, which hath beene a great commodity to Merchaunts, and a meanes of new voyages for ſuch, as had accuſtomed to go to ſea: who entring into thoſe countries, when they beheld the Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges decked with many faire plumes of diuers colours, and that they had their bodies likewiſe diuerſly painted, they made inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by what meanes they became ſo coloured:<note place="margin">Of Braſill, and other trees ſit for tincture.</note> who ſhewed them a certaine tree, which wee name (Braſill) and the Sauages call <hi>(O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauoutan).</hi> This tree is very faire to looke vpon, hauing the outter rinde of grayiſh colour, and the wood within red, and eſpeciallie the hart, which is the moſt excellent part of all the tree: and therewith merchants do chiefly furniſh themſelues. This tree hath leaues like the Box tree, as ſmall, but thicker, and fuller, and alwaies greene: and it beareth not any fruit, or gumme. That which groweth in the land of Morpion, and at Cabo Frio, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any other. And there alſo is great ſtore and quantitie of other trees ſeruing for tincture, and euery one of a ſundry colour. One is ſo red, that it imitateth in freſh colour the fineſt ſcarlet of the world. Another hath the inſide ſo yealow, as nothing can bee ſeene to approach neerer the pure colour thereof. Some are all black, and others reddiſh: and there are ſome of ſo faire a purple colour, as the ancients neuer vſed fairer. Moreouer there is found a tree as white as fine paper, meruailous faire, and very pleaſant to behold: which might haue beene very good, in times paſt, to make tablets to write in, then when men were ignorant of the vſe of paper.

The Citron-tree is as great as the Orange-tree and Limon-tree: and the leaues thereof are alwaies greene, differing little or nothing from thoſe of the Orange-tree, being all of them pierced thorough with ſuch little holes, that they can ſcarce be diſcerned. The bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches therof be flexible, clad with a greene bark, &amp; thorny. It bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth bloſſomes ſomewhat purple, of the faſhion of a bell, hauing ſome fillets hanging in the midſt of them, &amp; they haue fruit at all times. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ripe citrons fal, there be others that wax ripe, &amp; others that begin to bud. But there is verie great difference in this fruit, both in bignes and in taſte. For there are ſome as big as Melons, as thoſe are vpon the coaſt of Genoa, &amp; in the iſles of the Adriaticke and Egean ſeas. Some are a little leſſe: others are as great as Limons, or a little greater, as are thoſe of the Lake of Garda, which are better with meate then all the reſt, and taſte more pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. And for the biggeſt, being not ſo good to eat (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue more ſubſtance) they are fit for Apothecaries to conſerue them in ſugar or in honie. All of them beare the colour of gold; they are long like Limons, hauing a thicker rinde, wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled without, and of a ſweete ſmell. They haue a ſharpe pith within, full of iuice, in which the graine is hidden, in figure like to barley cornes, being couered with an hard peele, and of bitter taſte. They grow all the yeere long, and are gathered when they be yellow. Moreouer theſe trees are nouriſhed by the

They are ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their graines, and planted in twigs, boughes and graffes.<note place="margin">Propertie of Citrons.</note> The propertie of their fruit is to reſiſt poiſons, which their graine doth chiefly effect. And the decoction of citrons doth ſweeten the breath, if one waſh his mouth with it. Being put whole into cheſts with apparell, they doe not onely cauſe them to ſmell ſweete, but doe alſo defend them from moths. If they be eaten rawe, they are of hard digeſtion, and ingender groſſe humors: but hauing beene confected in honie or ſugar, they heate the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke well, and fortifie it. They are good againſt melancholie, and all maladies proceeding thereof. The graine is eſpecially good againſt the ſtinging of ſerpents, being taken in drinke, and applied outwardly. Their ſharpe iuice doth repreſſe choler, and is very good againſt the plague: by meanes whereof phiſitions doe happily vſe the ſirrope which is made of it againſt peſtilent feuers. Likewiſe the ſharpe and drie qualitie ruleth in the iuice of citrons, and therefore it is drie and cold in the third degree: but the rinde thereof is drie, with much bitterneſſe: ſo that it is drie in the ſecond degree, not cold, but temperate, a little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the meane. Their meate is of groſſe and flegmaticke ſubſtance, and their kernell bitter, and looſening, heating, and drying in the ſecond degree. If a citron be boiled whole in roſe water and ſugar, till ſuch time as it be all conſumed into iuice, and if one take euery morning to the quantitie of a ſpoonefull of this iuice, it will be a ſoueraigne preſeruatiue againſt the plague.</p>
                  <p>Limons alſo haue the very ſame propertie, and their iuice killeth the itch of the bodie, it clenſeth the ſpots thereof,<note place="margin">Of Limons.</note> deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wormes, taketh away pimples in the face, killeth wormes in the bellie, and being mingled with ſirrope, it is ſingular good againſt hot and contagious feuers.

Likewiſe if you ſteepe for certaine howers golde therein, it wil diminiſh in waight. In briefe, limons doe not much differ from the vertue and nature of citrons: but they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſomewhat leſſe, longer, and not of ſo thicke a rinde, fuller of iuice, ſharper in taſte, almoſt alike in ſeede, of colour pale.</p>
                  <p>Oranges are more round, and being ripe they haue a very

The iuice within, whereof they be full, is not in all of one taſte; for ſome are ſweete, ſome ſower, and ſome tart. Orange-trees are alwaies greene like citron-trees. They haue leaues like laurell, broad, thicke, ſmooth, ſweete, and pointed. Their branches likewiſe are flexible, pricklie, and couered with a greene whitiſh coloured barke. Their bloſſomes are white, of a very excellent ſmell, and are diligently gathered by perfumers, where there is any quantitie, for the compoſition of perfumes. Some alſo diſtill water of them, not onely for the excellencie of the ſmell thereof, but alſo to ſerue in medicine, eſpecially againſt peſtilent feuers, which cauſe bliſters. Being taken in drinke, it is very profitable when neede requireth to haue infected humors euacuated out of the inner part of the bodie to the outtermoſt part by ſweatings: for this water doth cauſe much ſweating, and doth greatly comfort the hart. The peele of oranges is hotter, ſharper, and bitterer in taſte then that of citrons and limons. And ſweete oranges are hot in all parts: but the iuice of all others is cold, and reſiſteth corruption. Wherefore they are good againſt feuers, which the ſweete are not. Moreouer their iuice preſſed out of the rinde doth eaſily inflame: and doth alſo penetrate through great tenuitie within a glaſſe, euen to the wine therein contained.</p>

It is planted of twigs, &amp; faire and fruitful yoong branches pulled from off the boughes of the tree, being very thicke, and of a foote and halfe long. Oliue-trees haue long pointed leaues, thicke, ſmooth, greene aboue, and whitiſh vnderneath, bitter in taſte, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharpe. They bud in Iulie, and haue white flowers hanging in cluſters, out of which grow the fruit, greene at firſt, and as they ripen paler; then waxe they purple, and at laſt turne blacke. They are gathered in the latter moneths of the yeere, being no ſooner ripe. They are ſtrowed vpon the floore, till ſuch time as they become wrinckled. Afterwards they are ground, and then put into the preſſe with hot water, and ſo they yeeld their oile. The wood of the oliue-tree is faire, full of veines, ſpeckled, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and burneth as well greene as drie. It is in no wiſe ſubiect to vermine, eſpecially ſo long as it is planted, bicauſe of the odour thereof which is ſtrong, yea it defendeth all other plants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:8737:173"/>
which are neere vnto it, as likewiſe through the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof it cauſeth Cabbages and Lettuſe to die, and all other moiſt herbes, which are ſowed in the plot with it.<note place="margin">Of the vſe of Oliues.</note> Oliues are gathered for two occaſions, either that oile may be extracted out of them, or that they may be reſerued for bankets, wherein they are ſerued to excite the appetite: but all kindes of oliues doe not ſerue indifferently for theſe two vſes: for the greateſt are beſt to eate, and the leaſt to drawe oile out of. They which are kept for feaſts are conſerued in brine, and ſalted vineger, in ſuch ſort as they retaine their naturall verdure. For the propertie of the oliue, it hath in it a very reſtringent vertue; for the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the leaues in a clyſter, ſtaieth the flux of the bellie: and the iuice preſſed out of the leaues with white wine and raine water, reſtraineth all manner of bloodie flixe. The licour which diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out of the greene wood as it burneth, healeth the itch, tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ringwormes. New oliues being eaten prouoke the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and get a good ſtomacke, although they harden the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Being very ripe they are moderately hot, otherwiſe they are more binding and cooling. The oile that is extracted out of oliues is of ſingular vertue, being either applied outwardly, or taken inwardly, according to the indiſpoſed parts of the bodie: it looſeneth and mollifieth the bellie, dulleth the malice of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and doth ſubtilly driue them away, yea if any venim or burning happen on the skin of the bodie, and begin to make an vlcer or ſore there, nothing is better to heale this hurt, then to annoint it with new freſh oile of oliues.</p>
                  <p>The Pomegranate tree alſo is to bee no leſſe eſteemed of,<note place="margin">Of the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate tree, and of the fruit thereof.</note> then the forenamed trees, becauſe of the excellency of the fruit thereof. The leaues of it reſemble thoſe of the Oliue-tree, of a darck-greene colour, very thick, and full of many red ſtrakes, hanging by a red ſtalke. The branches are pliable, and full of prickles. The bloſſomes red, and open like bels, the mouth of them cut in faſhion of a ſtar: out of which proceede thinne red leaues, with certaine ſmall ſeedes hanged by the midſt, like them in a roſe. The fruit is couered with a rinde like vnto leather, red without, and yealow within, full of infinite pointed graines, red, full of a wine-like iuyce, with a ſtone in them. And theſe graines are ſeparated one from another with maruailous cunning of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by fine thin yealow skinnes. Moreouer there are three ſorts of Pomegranates, ſweete, ſharpe, and winie. And the qualitie of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:8737:174"/>
them all is reſtringent, but not alike. For by their taſt you may iudge of their difference. And their graines are more binding &amp; drying, then their iuice: the rinde more then the graines; and the bloſſomes haue the ſame virtue with the fruit. And the powder of a Pomegranate, dryed in an ouen, in a new earthen pot cloſe ſtopped, beeing taken in drinck, is maruailous ſingular to ſtay the flux of the bellie. The leaues alſo of a Pomegranate tree well beaten, or the iuice of them mixed with oile of roſes, doth verie much eaſe inueterated paines of the head, beeing often laide to the forehead. The boughes of this tree do chaſe away venemous beaſts; for which cauſe the ancients were wont to lay them ouer, and vnder their beds. The decoction of the root beeing drunck, doth alſo kill great wormes in the belly, and doth void them out. Now haue wee ſaid enough concerning trees for the ſubiect by vs vndertaken: To morrow wee will diſcourſe of the moſt ſingular hearbes and rootes, to the end that in each ſort of all kindes of creatures, wee may haue ſomewhat wherein to acknowledge in the chiefeſt manner the infinite power, and vnſpeakeable boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of him, who hath made all theſe things for the vſe of man.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE knowledge of Symples hath alwaies beene had in ſuch eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt the Ancients, that many great Monarchs both Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Romaines, although they were much troubled in the gouernment of their eſtates, haue neuertheleſſe ſtudied how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this ſcience, and to illuſtrate it. For indeed it is not onely pleaſant and delectable, but alſo verie profitable and neceſſarie. And for this cauſe they haue been much commended who haue diligently written bookes concerning plants, and concerning the vertues of them. And ſurely we are not a little beholding to their diligence, by reaſon of the commodities that doe thereby redound vnto vs daily for the maintenance of our health, which is the thing moſt to be deſired of vs in all the world. For ſo much then as we haue ſo many goodly volumes amongſt vs, that all perſons may thereby with ſmall trauell become learned in this part of phiſicke, which is abundantly therein entreated of, we wil ſatisfie our ſelues to paſſe away this day in diſcourſing onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the moſt ſingular herbes and rootes, which wee could therein note, and as we yet do beare in memorie.</p>
                  <p>All herbes may be diuided into two kindes, one is vnder the name of pot-herbes, the other of phiſick-herbes: although in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie truth, there is in all of them, yea in many of thoſe which are moſt common, verie apt and proper vertues for the aide and maintenance of health, and healing of diſeaſes. But omitting thoſe which are vſed in common foode, and which are well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to euerie man, we will onely ſpeake of the moſt excellent in propertie, in reſpect of their maruellous effects in the nature of men. Amongſt which, although Mallowes be verie common, yet
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:8737:175"/>
are they woorthie of conſideration.<note place="margin">Of Mallowes and of their propertie.</note> And we read that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents did ſow this plant in their gardens of deliberate purpoſe: for in thoſe daies they did eat them like other ordinarie herbes. And euen to this day in Italy, they are ſo well ordered by the gardiners, that they will grow as big as a ſhrub, yea in ſixe or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen moneths. We neede not make heere a particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mallowes; for there is none but knoweth them well enough: but their vertue is verie admirable: for their leaues ſod, being eaten do take away all hoarſenes; and being powned with ſage leaues, they make a ſingular plaiſter for wounds &amp; other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations: they are alſo very good againſt bitings of venemous beaſts being applied with leekes and onions: and the iuice of them dropt in ones eare, appeaſeth the tingling therein. Being ſod rootes and all, till ſuch time as the decoction bee all verie thicke and clammie, they are giuen to women (to drinke) who are deliuered of their children with great difficultie; which helpes them much: and the iuice drunke to the quantitie of halfe a pound waight, doth profit them as much. Their ſeed alſo drunke with red wine, doth deliuer one from all deſire to vomit. And their yoong and tender ſtalkes being eaten with ſalt, vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp; oyle (as Sparage alſo) are verie healthfull &amp; laxatiue. Sixe ounces of their iuice being drunke, is verie good for melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie people, and for mad-folkes. In briefe the Mallow is verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in many things, and was for that cauſe called by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents <hi>(Omnimorbia)</hi> that is to ſay, good againſt all diſeaſes.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the wilde Mallowe, and the propertie thereof.</note>The wilde Mallowe hath no fewer properties, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by the Greekes <hi>(Althaea)</hi> as beeing ſingular amongſt all ſimples, and fit for many medicines: the vſe thereof beeing very ordinarie in phiſick: and it is a common hearbe knowne by euery one. Beeing ſod in wine, or in honied water, or beaten, and applied alone, it is good for all wounds, againſt the kings euill, againſt wormes in the eare, impoſtumes, inflammation of the breaſt, rupture of the fundament, ventoſities, and ſhrincking of the ſinewes: for it reſolueth, ripeneth, breaketh, and healeth. The leaues thereof incorporated with oile are good to applie to all bitings, and burnings by fire: the ſeede and root of this plant haue the ſame operation with the leafe: but they are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and more drying and abſterſiue. The ſeede is good againſt the Dyſenteria, againſt ſpitting of bloud, and flux of the bellie: and ſo alſo is the decoction of the root. And both of them ſerue
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:8737:175"/>
greatly for difficultie in making water, for grauell in the bodie, and do breake the ſtone in the reines. I muſt not faile here, to remember amongſt the moſt excellent herbes, the purple violet,<note place="margin">Of the Purple-violet, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof.</note> for becauſe of the admirable virtues, which it containeth. I will not ſpeake of the rare beautie of the flower thereof, nor of the ſweete and pleaſant ſmell thereof, though it bee to be maruailed at. But wee may affirme it to bee as excellent and ſingular a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as may bee found in any part of the world. For violets are temperate, and very good to alter and change the ill qualitie of humors, and to euacuate them. They chiefly purge choler, and qualifie the vehemencie thereof. They are good for paines in the head which proceede from heat: they cauſe ſleepines: mollifie the pricking of the breſt, and of the lunges: they are profitable againſt the ſquinancie, againſt the falling of the pallet in the mouth: they chiefly ſerue againſt inflammations of the breaſt, and of the ſide: and ſtaunch thirſt. Being dry they open the liuer, cauſe inflammations to ceaſe, and are very fit againſt the Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. Moreouer the iuice of Violets, and the ſirup that is made of them, mollifie the bellie, and they bee good to vſe in pleuriſies, to purge. And if any one receiue a blow vpon the head, he ſhalbe kept from dizzines, and other greater inconueniences, if ſoone after he is ſtroken, he drinke the flowers of Violets brayed, and vſe this drinke for ſome time. It is alſo a ſingular, and gentle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and of no leſſe virtue then Caſſia; if you drinke ſo much of the infuſion of the roots of Violets in white wine as you canne hold in foure fingers, after they haue beene beaten in a morter, beeing ſteeped a whole night in wine, and afterwards ſtrained through a cleane linnen cloth, which drinke you may ſweeten by putting ſugar therein. This ſecret was taught me by a learned phiſition of our time, and I haue oftentimes ſeene the experience thereof.</p>
                  <p>Betonie is likewiſe an hearb that is ſtored with many great virtues and properties. For which cauſe the Italians,<note place="margin">Of Betonie and the propertie thereof.</note> when they would highly praiſe any one, ſay in a common prouerb <hi>(Tuhai piu virtu, che non ha la Betonica)</hi> Thou art endewed with more vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, then Betonie is. This herb hath a ſmall ſtalke, and in many places is found of a cubit in height: hauing leaues like an oake, ſoft, long, cut round about, of ſweete ſmell, great neere to the roote, and the ſeed thereof at top of the ſtalke lookes like that of ſauorie. Now for the propertie of this plant; the leaues thereof
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:8737:176"/>
brayed and layde to wounds in the head, doe preſently ſearch them, and healing them from day to day, it is not long ere they fortifie the hurt part. Being beaten and applied to the forehead, they heale the paine of the eies: which likewiſe the decoction of the root doth, being ſod in water, til one third part be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed, if you waſh your eies therewith. The iuice of the leaues being drunke, doth purge downwards that blood, the great abundance whereof doth dazzle and dimme the ſight. Wherefore Betonie being eaten doth ſharpen and clarifie it. And being beaten with a verie little ſalt, and put into the noſthrils, it ſtancheth bleeding at the noſe. And the warme iuice being diſtilled with oyle of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and put into the eares, doth aſſwage the paine of them. The vſe of this herbe is verie profitable for thoſe, which are pained at the ſtomacke, and haue ſhort breath, who ſpit corruption, who haue paine in their liuer and ſpleene, and are troubled with run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the raines; it prouoketh vrine, eaſeth the gnawing of the bellie and guttes (if it proceede not from encreaſing of humours) and is verie good againſt dropſies, breaketh the ſtone, ſtayeth the ſpitting of blood; and taken faſting, keepeth from drunkennes; being drunke often with wine, it healeth the iaundiſe, refreſheth thoſe that haue trauelled farre, ſharpneth the appetite, reſiſteth poyſons, venims, and bitings of ſerpents, and all other venemous and mad beaſts; being not onely taken inwardly, but alſo applied outwardly to the wounds. In ſumme this plant hath ſo many properties therein, that a verie learned phiſition amongſt the ancients hath written a whole booke thereof.<note place="margin">Anton. Muſa.</note>

It hath neither ſtalke, flower, nor ſeed, but hath many leaues growing out of a roote, which are cut like thoſe of mountaine Polipodie, red and hairie vnderneath, and greene aboue. The decoction of this herbe is good for all melancholie paſſions, it conſumeth ſpleene, is profitable for thoſe that can hardly make water, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſtone in the bladder, and is good for them that haue the iaundiſe. Some bray Ceterach leaues, to lay them hauing beene ſteeped in wine vpon the ſpleene, which ſerueth well for to open it. The yealow powder which is found behinde thoſe leaues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunke with a little white Amber, and with the iuice of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or of Purſlaine, is maruellous profitable for thoſe that are

                  <p>Saint Iohns-woort alſo is a verie excellent herbe. It is full of branches of a ſpan in height, reddiſh, bearing a leafe like to Rue,<note place="margin">Of Saint Iohns wort, and the propertie thereof.</note> hauing a yealow flower like to a violet; which being rubbed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fingers, yeeldeth iuice as red as blood. This plant is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Millepertuis</hi> (or thouſand holes) becauſe the leaues of it are all full of ſo ſmall holes, that one can ſcarce ſee them, but onely betwixt their ſight and the ſun. It beareth ſeed in rough, round, and ſomewhat long huskes. This herbe hath power to open, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue, ſearch, and binde againe. It heateth and drieth, and is of ſubtile ſubſtance; wherefore it prouoketh vrine. The ſeede thereof being drunke with wine, voideth the ſtone out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and reſiſteth poyſons both the ſeed, and herbe being eaten or taken in drinke, or outwardly applied, healeth inuenomed bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. The water diſtilled of this herbe when it beareth flower, is ſingular good for thoſe that are ſubiect to the falling ſicknes, or are troubled with the palſie; if it be giuen them to drinke. The ſeed being beaten into powder with the iuice of Renouée, is good againſt ſpitting of blood. It purgeth the belly: the flowers and ſeed alſo haue a maruellous vertue to heale all wounds, except ſuch as are in the head. Wherefore the oyle, wherein the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and cods full of ſeede ſhall haue beene long time ſteeped in the ſunne, doth heale verie well all greene wounds, eſpecially if it be mixed with Turpentine. If the belly be rubbed with this oyle, it is good againſt the Dyſenteria: and a ſpoonefull thereof being drunke killeth the wormes. There is a ſingular balme made of the flowers thereof, with the fruit of an elme and roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buds, putting all together in a glaſſe bottle, and ſetting it in the ſunne, till ſuch time as all be ſo conſumed that it ſeemeth to be putrified: then muſt all be ſtrained thorough a cloth, and kept ſo to be vſed, chiefely for wounds and hurts of the bodie.

                     <note place="margin">Of Celondine and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties thereof.</note>IN the deſcription of plants, we finde that there is mention made of two kindes of Celondine, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called (Clarie) either of them indued with many vertues. That which is called great Celondine, hath a ſlender ſtalke of a cubit long, and hath leaued branches. The leaues thereof are ſoft and greene, ſomewhat inclining towards a blew. The flower reſembleth that of the white Violet, which buddeth out according to the order of euerie leafe. It beareth long and ſlender cods, made pointed, wherein the ſeed is enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. This herbe is of a verie abſterſiue and hot qualitie. The iuice thereof is verie good to take out ſpots, and the pin and web in the eies: but becauſe it is verie ſharp, you muſt before you applie it, mixe it with thoſe things that may repreſſe the ſharpnes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as namely with womans milke: being put into hollow teeth, it looſeneth them that they fall out. If you rub warts therewith, they fall off and drie vp. The decoction of the roote being drunk with anniſe ſeed and white wine, doth heale the iaundiſe, and is good for eating vlcers, and being chewed it aſſwageth the paine in the teeth. Some make report, that ſwallowes cauſe their yoong ones to recouer loſt ſight, by applying this herbe vnto them:<note place="margin">

Some Alchimiſts ſay for <hi>(Chelidonium) (Celidonium)</hi> that is (the gift of heauen) vaunting that they can extract out of this herbe a quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence, not onely fit for their purpoſes, but profitable alſo to conſerue the health of man, and to heale many diſeaſes. Celon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine the leſſe is without ſtalke,<note place="margin">Of Celondine the leſſe.</note> the leaues are round and thicke, the flower yealow, hanging at a ſmall ſtalke. It keepeth but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie little while: for it ſpringeth and dieth in the Spring-time. And it is ſo named, becauſe it beareth flower in that ſeaſon, when ſwallowes come in, as alſo great Clarie doth. It is hot and drie in the fourth degree full, becauſe of the great ſharpnes thereof. And therefore ſo ſoone as it is applyed, it breaketh the skin, and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:8737:177"/>
cauſeth bad nailes to fall off. The iuice thereof ſnuffed vp into the noſe, doth greatly purge the braine. And a gargariſme made of the decoction thereof with honie, hath the ſame vertue, and euacuateth all euill humours in the breaſt.</p>
                  <p>Cammocke (or Reſt-harrow) hath alſo many ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. It is a plant well knowen by countrey-folkes,<note place="margin">Of Cammock and the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof.</note> becauſe that as well with the branches, as with the interlaced rootes, it oftentimes ſtayeth the plough, maugre the oxen. It alſo vexeth mowers and reapers much. For how thicke lether ſoeuer they weare, yet will this pearce through like an aul, &amp; as with needles wherewith it is armed being ripe. This herbe hath many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of a ſpan long, turned with many knots; the leaues thereof are ſmall and ſlender like vnto the leaues of Lentiles, approching verie neere to the forme of Rue, ſomewhat hairie, and of a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſweet ſent. The branches are full of verie ſharpe and ſtrong prickles. The flower is purple, enclining to white, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times yealow. Amongſt other properties that this plant hath, it is aboue all moſt ſingular in the roote thereof for to breake the ſtone in the reines and to voide it out, eſpecially when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits through which the vrine paſſeth are ſtopped vp. Some that haue vſed for a verie long time, to take the powder of the peele of this roote with wine, haue beene holpen of the ſtone. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the teſtimonie of <hi>Mathiolus:</hi> A certaine man hauing vſed for many moneths together of the powder onely of this roote, did helpe and heale himſelfe of the burſtnes in the cods, after that all phiſitions had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ouer, except they might cut him as they had concluded. The decoction alſo of this roote, and water that hath beene diſtilled, cleanſeth the reines of grauell, prouoketh vrine, purgeth the bladder, the mouth thereof being ſtopt vp with clammie humours, and is ſingular good to open the liuer, and all veſſels of ſenſe, life and motion. To make this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you muſt take fower pound of the rindes of greene rootes: and being cut ſmall, ſet them a ſteepe in eight pounds of malme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or of good wine, then diſtill them in a glaſſe limbecke in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo Mariae.</p>

And therfore it purgeth downwards, and driueth into the vrine all cholericke humors. It doth moſt principally comfort the ſtomacke, and for this cauſe wine was made thereof called by the ſame name: of the tops thereof is a decoction made with the root of Dandelion, which is very good to heale the iaundiſe. The iuice of wormwood mixed with the kernell of a peach killeth wormes. This herbe prouoketh vrine: being taken faſting it preſerueth from drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe: doth ſharpen the appetite: it is a ſoueraigne remedie for thoſe that are ſubiect to ſtuffings by eating toad-ſtooles, if they drinke the iuice thereof, with vineger. Being taken with wine it is good againſt poiſon, with milke and home it is good to rub them that are troubled with the ſquinancie. The fume of the decoction thereof caſeth paines in teeth and in the eares. And being made in wine of raiſins, it aſſwageth the paine of the eies if they be annointed therewith. Being laid with oile of roſes vpon a ſtomack weakned through long ſicknes, it doth fortifie it: with figs, vineger, and meale of darnell it is good againſt the dropſie, and for thoſe that are grieued in their ſpleene. Wormwood put into cheſts defendeth apparel from worm-eating.

                     <note place="margin">Hyſſop and the property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note>Hyſſop is a common plant, but woorthy of great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is like a ſhrub ſprouting many wooden branches out of the roote, of a foot and halfe high. The leaues are ſet euery where about the ſtalks here and there, being long, hard, ſweete in ſmell, hot in taſte, and ſomewhat bitter. It beareth flowers on the top of the ſtalke of a blew colour, like eares of corne. The qualitie of hyſſop is pearſing, attenuatiue, opening and abſterſiue: and therefore it hath the vertue to heate and to purifie. Being ſod with figs, water, honie and rue, and taken in drinke, it is good for inflammations of the lungs, for an old cough, difficultie of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, catarrhes, and for thoſe which cannot breath except they ſtand ſtill: and it is good alſo to kill wormes in the bellie. Being beaten with ſalt and cumin, it is good againſt bitings of ſerpents, if it be laid thereupon with honie. It is profitable for thoſe that are ſubiect to the falling ſicknes, being miniſtred in any ſort vnto
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:8737:178"/>
them. Being taken in drinke it voideth fleame, and chiefly that which is in the breaſt and lungs. It ſerueth alſo for flegmaticke maladies of the braine and ſinewes, not onely to purge them, but alſo to fortifie them. It driueth away ventoſitie, mooueth appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, prouoketh vrine, freeth from quakings and ſhakings of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and ſharpeneth the ſight. It maintaineth good colour in one, and is good for the ſpleene, and againſt the dropſie, and is ſingular againſt ſquinancies, being gargariſed with the decoction of figs. The oile that is made of the leaues and flowers, helpeth refrigerated or benummed ſinewes, and ſtrengthneth them. In briefe the admirable vertues of this plant haue begotten this prouerbe, (He that eateth hyſſop ſhall liue but too long.) But the plentie thereof that is euery where, cauſeth (euen as it is with all other common things) that it is made but ſmall account of, and is very ſeldome vſed in phiſicke.</p>
                  <p>Sage alſo is very common, ſo that there is no garden but is filled therewith: yet the vertue thereof is not a whit leſſe,<note place="margin">Of Sage, and the propertie thereof.</note> as is daily experimented, to the great profit of many. It hath many long, ſquare, and white branches. The leaues are like thoſe of a quince tree, but more long, more rough, more thicke, ſharpe, ſtrong, of good ſmell, and yet ſomwhat vnpleaſant. Many make two kindes of ſage, common ſage, and wilde ſage. But we may note that garden ſage is all one with field ſage: neither can much difference be marked in them, ſaue in the leaues, which are thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whiter, and rougher in wilde then in garden ſage. This plant is very ſingular againſt all cold and flegmaticke diſeaſes in the head, and againſt all paines of the ioints, either being taken in drinke, or applied in fomentations. Wherefore it is very good for them who haue the falling diſeaſe, or are ſicke of the lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and for thoſe that haue their members benummed or ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. It is profitable againſt defluxions of fleame, and maladies in the breaſt. It is good for great bellied women to eate, which are ſubiect to trauell before their time, for euery light cauſe: for it keepeth the childe in the wombe, and doth quicken it. If you giue three or foure ounces of the iuice of ſage to them that ſpit blood, that they may drinke it faſting in a morning with honie, the blood will preſently be ſtaied. The vſe of ſage in pottage, and otherwiſe ſerueth to ſharpen the appetite, and cleanſe the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke being full of ill humors. In ſumme, when occaſion is to heate, drie, and binde, ſage is a very good and fit medicine.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of Mints, and their property.</note>Mints haue likewiſe many great properties, and are very common, both in gardens and fields. Whereof though there be many kindes (for ſome haue ſmall and criſped leaues, others haue the ſtalke and flower red, and others white) yet is there no great matter to be made of theſe differences, conſidering that one ſelfe ſame vertue reſideth in all. Mints beaten, and made into a plaiſter do comfort a weake ſtomacke. It is a ſoueraigne thing to reſtore the ſmell, and feeling to thoſe that haue loſt it, ſo that it be often held to the noſe. The leaues thereof dried, and brought into powder, kill wormes in little children. The iuice drunke with vineger, ſtancheth blood; with the iuice of a ſower pomegranate it reſtraineth vomitings, hickets, and the colicke paſſion. Mints laid vpon the forehead aſſwage the headach: and laid vpon too tender dugs that are ful of milk, it eaſeth the paine of them: applied with ſalt it is good for bitings by dogs, and with honied water it is good againſt paines in the eares. The water of the whole plant diſtilled in a glaſſe-limbecke in a bath of hot water, and drunke to the waight of fower ounces, ſtaieth blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at noſe.

                     <note place="margin">Of Thyme and the propertie thereof.</note>AMongſt common herbes admirable in their properties, Thyme is worthie to be noted. Now there are two ſorts thereof; one bearing ſundry twigs laden with verie manie little narrow leaues, hauing ſmall heads at the top full of purple flowers: and the other is as hard as wood, more branched, and like vnto Sauorie. In propertie it is hot, and dry in the third degree. And therefore it prouoketh vrine, doth heat, and being taken in drinke doth purge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes. It is good to make one ſpit out the ill-humours of the lungs, and in the breaſt. Fower drams of drie thyme puluerized,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8737:179"/>
being miniſtred faſting to one that hath the gout, with two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and an halfe of honied vineger, doth profit them verie much: for it purgeth choler, and other ſharpe humours. It is good alſo for diſeaſes of the bladder: and the waight of a dram being taken with a ſpoonefull of honied water, it is good for ſuch as begin to haue a ſwollen belly: for the ſciatica, and paine in the reines, in the ſides, and in the breaſt, for inflations and ſtitches about the forepart of the belly, for melancholie perſons; for thoſe that are troubled in minde, and are in continuall fearfulnes, if three drams be giuen to them faſting with a ſpoonefull of honied-vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it will doe them much good. It is profitable alſo againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the eies, and vehement paines therof, and againſt the goute in the feete, being taken with wine. The vſe thereof is verie good for them that haue but bad ſight. Out of Thyme there is an oyle extracted of the colour of gold, which commeth forth with the water, when the herbe being freſh and greene is diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a bathe of hot water. This oyle ſmels like a Citron, and is verie tart in taſte, and good for all things, which haue need to be heated. But we muſt note that heed muſt be taken, that to all the foreſaid purpoſes blacke thyme be not vſed: for it corrupteth the temperature of the perſon, and ingendreth choler. And therfore that thyme muſt be choſen, which beareth a carnation flower, and that for the beſt yet which beareth a white flower.</p>
                  <p>Sauorie alſo is an herbe knowen vnto all,<note place="margin">Of Sauory.</note> and hath the ſame properties and vertues which thyme hath, being taken in ſuch manner. There are two kindes thereof: one is like to thyme, ſomewhat leſſe and more tender, bearing a bud full of greene flowers enclining to purple. The other is greater and more branched, which is often found in gardens hauing many boughes that ſpread about it, being round and woodie. The leaues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are greater then thoſe of thyme, ſomewhat ſtrong and harder, which doe here and there grow about the branches in bunches togither, after the ſpringing whereof there grow out little buds enuironed with leaues, which are much leſſe then the other, wherein grow ſmall carnation flowers. The leaues and flowers of ſauorie being made in a garland or chaplet, and ſet vpon the head of ſuch as ſleep, do waken them. Being vſed in a cataplaſme with wheat-meale ſod together in wine it is verie auaileable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt griefe of the ſciatica. But the vſe of ſauorie is chiefly good for healthfull perſons, whether it be in pottage, or in ſauce, or
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:8737:180"/>
otherwiſe. And it being dryed in the ſhade, and brought into powder, may be vſed inſteed of ſpices, and ſo may Thyme and Marierom, with maruellous profit for health: and ſtrange drugs tbat are hurtfull may be ſpared, as pepper and ginger are, being commonly vſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Marierom.</note>Marierom is ſo good for all perſons, ſo that there are but few people which haue it not, either in their gardens, or in earth pots: the whole plant is verie odoriferous, and moſt profitable in phiſicke. It is branched with ſmall plyable twigs, with long whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and hairie leaues growing about thoſe twigs. It beareth flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in great number on the top of the ſtalkes, and buds of the colour of the herbe, being long, and compoſed of an heape of ſcales, wel compact together, out of which groweth a litle graine. In propertie it reſolueth, and is attenuatiue, opening and coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratiue. It is excellent againſt all cold diſeaſes of the head, and of the ſinewes, both outwardly applied and taken in drinke: as alſo for griefes in the eares, noiſe in them, and difficult hearing, if ſome of the iuice of the leaues therof be dropt into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The iuice thereof alſo being ſnuffed vp into the noſe, purgeth the fleame of the head, cleanſeth the braine, and fortifieth it. The vſe of this plant and of the decoction thereof, is good againſt all euill in the breaſt, which may ſtop the free courſe and recourſe of breath. It is profitable for them that are diſeaſed in the liuer, and in the ſpleene: not onely freeing the liuer and ſpleene from oppilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſtoppings; but alſo making them ſtrong and ſound. The decoction thereof alſo being drunke, is good in the beginning of a dropſie, for difficultie in making water, and for pulling in ones belly. And the leaues thereof ſerue againſt the ſtingings of ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, being laid thereupon with ſalt and vineger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Rue.</note>Rue likewiſe by reaſon of the great and exquiſite properties thereof deſerueth to be remembred. This plant is alwaies green, verie thicke of iuicie leaues, many hanging at one ſtalke of ſmall growth, but very broad, of a dark green colour. It produceth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little boughes &amp; branches, &amp; on the top yellow flowers; out of which grow little heads diuided into fower parts, wherein ſmall black ſeed is incloſed. This herb is very attenuatiue, inciſiue, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiue, reſolutiue, prouocatiue, &amp; driueth out ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>toſities very force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. For it is hot in the third degree, and not onely ſharp in taſte, but bitter alſo: by meanes whereof it may reſolue and penetrate groſſe and clammie humours; and through the ſame qualities
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:8737:180"/>
prouoke vrine. It doth alſo conſiſt of ſubtile parts, and is num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt medicines, which drie greatly: and therefore it is good againſt inflations, aſſwaging the appetite of luſt, it reſolueth and freeth from all windines. The ſeed thereof drunke in wine, to the waight of fifteene ounces, is a ſingular remedie againſt all poyſon. The leaues eaten alone faſting, or with nuts and drie figs, do kill the power of venim, and are good againſt ſerpents. The decoction thereof drunke, is profitable againſt paines in the breaſt and in the ſides, inflammation of the liuer, the gout, and ſhakings of agues; being eaten raw or confected, it cleereth the ſight, is good againſt difficultie in breathing, and againſt the cough: being mixed with French cherries dried, it alayeth paines of the eies; being mixed with oyle of Roſes and vineger, it eaſeth the headach; being brayed and put into the noſe, it ſtancheth the bleeding thereof. The diſtilled water of it, infuſed into an equall portion of wine and roſe water, is ſoueraigne for the paine in the eies.</p>
                  <p>Parſley is ordinarie and common in all gardens,<note place="margin">Of Parſley.</note> and the vſe thereof great, and very commodious for the mouth and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. Neither is there any herbe more vſed in meates, and in ſauces. But it hath many properties in phiſicke, for which it is much to be commended. For the decoction of the leaues or rootes thereof openeth the paſſage of vrine, and purgeth out grauell that hath long laine in the vrine conduits: it eaſeth the colicke and paines in the raines, being vſed in manner of fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vpon the grieued parts. The ſeede thereof is yet of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vertue in the foreſaid effects: it ſerueth (beeing drunke) againſt venime of ſerpents, and driueth out ventoſities. The often vſage of parſley doth take away ſtinking of breath: being applied in a cataplaſme with crums of white bread it healeth tetters, aſſwageth the ſwelling of the dugs, and for women in childe-bed doth diminiſh their milke. There is alſo another kind of parſley called Marſh-parſley, commonly named (broad ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage) which hath as much or more efficacie in phiſicke then the other, eſpecially the ſeede thereof which hath moſt ſingular vſes. Which being ſharpe with great bitterneſſe, is hot in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a pearſing vertue. Wherefore it is good for wringings in the belly, windines of ſtomacke, &amp; for the colicke: it is ſingular in drinke, for paines in the ſides, in the raines, and in the bladder.</p>
                  <p>Fennell doth alſo conſiſt of two ſorts; one is of ſet fennel,<note place="margin">Of Fennell.</note> and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:8737:181"/>
the other wilde fennell. Garden or ſet fennell is very pleaſant in taſte, for the ſauorie ſweetenes thereof, and is profitable being vſed in phiſicke. The decoction of the leaues ſerue greatly for paines in the reines, being drunke, and prouoketh vrine. The herbe of fennell eaten, or the ſeede ſodden with barlie water doth make very much milke come into womens breaſts. The roote braied and applied with honie, healeth the bitings of dogs. The ſeede is excellent to ſuppreſſe winde, being taken after meales, though it be of hard digeſtion, and doth but badly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the bodie. But fennell is moſt principally good, both the leaues and ſeede thereof, to cleere the ſight: and therefore ſome preſſe out the iuice of the leaues, and tender ſtalks, which they preſerue and keepe for this purpoſe: And they doe alſo diſtill the water thereof for the ſame vſe. In the weſterne part of Spaine the fennell yeeldeth a licour like vnto gum, which is of greater efficacie then the iuice thereof in medicines for the eies. Wilde fennell is ſharper in taſte, hath greater leaues, and groweth higher, then garden fennell. The roote thereof hath a good ſent, and being taken in drinke doth profit them much that hardly make water: it is good againſt bitings of ſerpents; breaketh the ſtone, and healeth the iaundiſe: which the ſeede thereof doth likewiſe.

                  <p>IT would be very hard to finde out in one plant onely more vertues and properties, then they who haue trauelled to publiſh the ſcience of ſimples, haue attributed to roſemarie: and yet it ſeemeth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that it is fit for nothing but to make garlands and noſegayes, and being ſo very common, is not eſteemed to be of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie. Indeede it is a very ordinarie plant, and in Prouence it groweth to ſuch greatnes, that the people vſe it for fire-fewell like other wood: and the ſtocke is of ſuch compaſſe, that they make tables and harpes thereof: Yet all this lets not, but it may be of admirable vertue. For it is very good againſt cold diſeaſes
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:8737:181"/>
of the ſtomacke, againſt the colicke, and caſting vp of meate,<note place="margin">Of Roſemary, and the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble propertie thereof.</note> by eating it either in bread, or drinking it in powder with pure wine. It is profitable for ſuch as are diſeaſed in the liuer or ſpleen: for it doth not onely heate, purifie and open, but through the reſtringent vertue thereof it doth alſo fortifie. It is very good againſt all rheumes, and all cold maladies, againſt the falling euil, numbnes of members, the lethargie and palſie. It is good to waſh the head, and for fomentations of the ioints. It doth ſharpen the ſight, ſweeten the breath, and being boiled in vineger and hard wine, it ſtaieth the rheumes that fall into the teeth and gums, if the mouth be waſhed with this decoction hot. The powder ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of dried doth conſolidate greene wounds, if they be waſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with wine wherein roſemarie hath beene ſodden, and then the powder be ſtrowed on afterwards. The flowers thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in ſugar, are good for all things aforeſaide, particularly againſt cold paſſions of the hart, againſt maladies of the breaſt, and againſt the plague. The decoction of roſemarie made in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and taken in drinke doth heale the iaundiſe. So likewiſe doth the ſeede being drunke with pepper and white wine. In the plague time it is good to perfume the houſe with this plant, for the fume thereof driueth away ill aires.</p>
                  <p>Cammomill alſo groweth abundantly amongſt corne,<note place="margin">Of Cammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill.</note> and in the fieldes, bearing yellow flowers enuironed with whitiſh leaues, and is of a ſtrong ſauour. But to mollifie, reſolue, rarifie, and looſen, this plant is of ſingular operation: And in this reſpect no medicine is better for wearie folkes then a bath of cammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill. The leaues beaten, and put into white wine make a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble drinke, to heale quotidian and quartan agues: the decoction thereof drunke healeth paines in the ſide: and ſo doth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtilled of the flowers: which flowers being gathered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaues, beaten in a morter, &amp; formed with oile into trochisks, afterwardes diſſolued againe in oyle, if they bee therewith rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and chafed, which are troubled with feuers, from the crowne of the head to the foote, and that they preſently goe into bed to ſweate, they ſhall be holpen, bicauſe of the abundant heate that goeth out of their bodie. Cammomill is eſpecially good to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue feuers that are without inflammation of any chiefe intraile, principally thoſe which proceede from cholericke humors and thicknes of the skin. Being taken in drinke, or the fume thereof receiued in at the fundament, it is a great helpe to voide vrine

                     <note place="margin">Of the Lillie.</note>The lillie is likewiſe very woorthie of conſideration. It bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth long leaues, euer greene, ſmooth, and iuicie; it hath a ſtalke of two cubits high, round, ſtraight, euen, thicke, and ſtrong, all clad with leaues from the bottome to the top. At the top of the ſtalke growe three or fower little branches, out of which iſſue ſmall long heads of the colour of the herbe, which in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come faire lillies of exquiſite whiteneſſe, croſſed on the outſide, and the ends turned outwards round about. At the bottome of the flower growe certaine yellow ſtalks, as it were duſtie on the vpper ſide, of the faſhion of toongs, out of the midſt of which groweth one long one, hauing a round head of the colour of the herbe. There is no flower ſo high, and it ſurpaſſeth in beautie all other whiteneſſe. Now for the vertue of this plant. The leaues thereof are good beeing applied againſt the biting of ſerpents; beeing boiled they heale burnings, and confected in vineger, are good for wounds: water diſtilled of the flowers, are profitable for women that are deliuered of childe with great difficulty, and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out the after-burden, beeing mixed with ſaffron, and Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The oile drawne out of thoſe flowers is good againſt all cold diſeaſes of the ſinewes, as cramps, and palſies, and to mollifie all ſtiffenes in the ioynts, and all hard-ſwollen kernelles. Lillies long time ſteeped in oile, beeing applied hot, do ripen hot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes without paine, and do breake them, eſpecially ſuch as are in the ioints. And the bodie of the roots hath the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie. For beeing boiled, and braied with oile of roſes, they ripen impoſtumes, and beeing braied with hony they heale cut and lame ſinewes, clenſe the head of ſcabs, and clarifie the viſage, and make it ſmooth. The ſeede of Lillies alſo taken in drink, ſerueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bitings of ſerpents. And the water that is diſtilled of the flowers in a limbeck doth take wrinkles out of womens faces, and doth beautifie them very much.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of Baulme.</note>Baulme is a very odoriferous plant, and ſmelleth much like a Citron: the ſtalke and leaues thereof are ſomewhat rough, and many ſtalkes iſſue out of the roote. The property of it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce the heart, to comfort cold and moiſt ſtomacks, to helpe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, to euacuate the ſtoppings of the conduits of the braine, to heale feeblenes and faintnes of hart, to fortifie it being weake, eſpecially if the weakenes bee ſuch that it oftentimes breaketh ones ſleepe in the night: moreouer this hearb ſtaieth the panting

It hath alſo a laxatiue vertue, not ſo feeble, but that it clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and purgeth the ſpirits, and bloud of the hart and arteries, from all melancholie vapors: which it cannot do to the other parts of the bodie. The leaues thereof taken in drinke, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly applied, are good againſt ſtingings of the Tarantula, of Scorpions, and againſt the biting of dogs: and it is good to bath ſuch wounds with the decoction thereof. Beeing mixed with ſalt, they are profitable againſt the kings euill, and mundifie vlcers: and beeing applied, do aſſwage the paine of gowts. They are vſed in clyſters againſt the flux. Alſo the leaues taken in drinke with niter, are very good for them that are ſtopped by eating toad ſtooles, or muſhrums: and in loch for them that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſhrinking vp of the bellie, and breath with ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that they cannot do it except they ſtand vpright.</p>
                  <p>Graſſe,<note place="margin">Of Dogs-tooth.</note> or Dogs-tooth is one of the commoneſt herbs in the field, yea euen in leane grounds. The branches thereof ly a long vpon the earth, and are full of knots, out of which, and out of the top it often ſendeth new rootes. The leaues are very ſmall and pointed: it is maruailous in propertie. For the decoction thereof taken in drinke, healeth wringing in the bellie, and hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of water, and breaketh the ſtone and grauell in the bladder. The root braied and applied, ſearcheth wounds. And the iuice of the decoction thereof may bee vſed to the ſame effect: which the herb alſo doth, beeing beaten, and keepeth wounds from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation: if to the decoction thereof bee put a little wine, or hony, and the third part of ſo much Pepper, Myrrh, &amp; Franckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and be made to boile afterwards againe in ſome copper veſſell; it is a ſingular remedy for the tooth-ach, and the rheume which falleth into the eies. Graſſe alſo that hath ſeuen ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the knots, is very good for the headach beeing bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. It likewiſe ſtauncheth bleeding at noſe. The ſeede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth greatly prouoke vrine, and bindeth the bellie, and ſtaieth vomiting. It is ſpeciall good againſt byting of Dragons. There is found in ſome places of Germany a certaine kinde of graſſe, which is tilled with as great care, as other corne, or pulſe, becauſe the people vſeth the ſeede thereof in their meats, which ſeede they call (Mama) and they ſeeth it in pottage with fat meate, and finde it as good as Rice. It is ſmaller then millet, and very white.

                     <note place="margin">Of Pimpernell.</note>There are three ſorts of Pimpernell. One groweth very great, and hath a long root, the leaues are couched round vpon the earth, beeing cut and indented about: the ſtalke is ſquare, the flowers thick in bunches, ſmal and whitiſh. The next ſort is little, and hath a red ſtalke; the leaues ſmall, not ſo much cut, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dented. The third kinde is the moſt common, which is often eaten in ſallades, and ſet in gardens. The root of the two firſt kindes (wherein all their vertue lieth) is very good for paines in the reines, and bladder, which are cauſed by the ſtone. For it clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the reines of grauell, and driueth foorth long kept vrine. The iuice alſo of this root beeing drunke with wine, is ſingular againſt all poiſons, and bitings of venemous beaſts. For which cauſe ſome eſteeme much of this root, to bee vſed againſt the plague. The third kinde of Pimpernell is different in vertue from the former, although they be verie like in forme of leaues. For it is more reſtringent in taſte and verie nouriſhing; for which cauſe it may be thought to be of a binding nature. Wherefore it ſtayeth the Dyſenteria and other fluxes, and the vomiting of cholericke hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. It healeth wounds and vlcers, and it is of ſpeciall vſe in ointments that are made for wounds in the head, and for can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. Some phiſitions haue much commended it in the cure of peſtilent and contagious feuers: affirming alſo that the often vſage thereof is a ſoueraigne preſeruatiue againſt dangerous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.

                  <p>IT is wonderfull to rehearſe the vertues &amp; properties, which many affirme to vs in their writings to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in the <hi>Solanum,</hi> whereof the Ancients made fower kindes. But I will heere make mention of two onely, which are verie common,<note place="margin">Of Nightſhade and the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof.</note> ſith that the reſt are ſeldome found or neuer. The firſt kinde is called Night-ſhade, which is a ſmall little herbe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many pits in the ſtalke thereof; out of which grow blacke leaues, like to thoſe of Baſill, but a little greater. It beareth white flowers, yealow in the midſt in faſhion of a ſtarre. The fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:8737:183"/>
is round, hanging in cluſters, full of a winie iuice, no leſſe then Iuniper ſeede, wherein a ſmall white graine is encloſed: this fruit is of diuers colours; for in ſome plants it is blacke, in others yealow, and in ſome enclining towards a greene. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the propertie of this plant, the iuice of the fruit thereof, as likewiſe of the leaues mixed with oyle of roſes, and a little vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, is ſingular againſt the headach, when it is cauſed by heat. It is good for ſuch as are franticke, if one ſteepe linnen clothes therein, and lay them to the forepart of their head. In like ſort may they be applied to the forehead againſt hot rheumes that fal downe into the eies. It is good alſo to gargle it againſt inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the throat, and falling of the pallat. It is put in oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to heale ſore and grieuous vlcers. The leaues thereof bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ſalt, and laide on a plaiſter, breake impoſtumes that grow behinde the eares. In briefe, when need is to refreſh, to dry vp, or to reſtraine, night-ſhade is verie conuenient.</p>
                  <p>Now for the other kinde of Solanum, commonly called Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keng,<note place="margin">Of Alkakeng and the vertue thereof.</note> it hath leaues like vnto Nightſhade, but broader, ſtronger, ſomewhat ſharp, and not ſo black: the ſtalke thereof is ſupple, which beeing growne vp enclineth towards the ground. The flowers are white, out of which riſe little bladders as big as a nut, and growe ſharpe: they are compoſed of eight ſides, of equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one from another. And they are at firſt greene, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ripe, red: within them they containe fruit one graine in each of them, beeing faſtned to the bottome of the bladder, like to the ſeede of a red grape, both ſharp and bitter, and full of a great number of ſmall white graines within. In this fruit alſo is great vertue, not onely to prouoke vrine, but alſo to allay the burning heat thereof. For the iuice of it beeing drunke with the iuice of white poppie, or of the ſeed of Melons, or of Gourds, or with the decoction of Mallowes, or with barly water, is marueilous ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for the ſcorching heate of vrine. And this plant is ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to adders, that laying the roote thereof neere vnto them, they are ſodainly ſurpriſed with ſo great ſleepe, that they die there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The fruite thereof ſteeped in new wine is very good being laide on the eie lids. Some put it in a veſſell togither with ripe grapes, which they ſuffer to boyle for certaine daies togither, out of which they extract a very profitable wine, for ſuch as are troubled with grauell: euacuating the grauell marueilouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, and clenſing the reines being drunke to the waight of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:8737:184"/>
fowre ounces. And the ſame fruite taken in drinke healeth the iaundiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Pellitorie.</note>Pellitorie is an herbe very well knowne, and hath manie great properties, the leaues thereof are rough, the ſtalke redde, about which are bitter graines, which are fit to lay amongſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. This plant hath the vertue to refreſh and binde, for which cauſe it is ſingular good to heale greene wounds. For if it be laide vpon a wound (being halfe beaten and very freſh) and be not taken off for three daies togither, there ſhall be no neede to vſe any other medicine. The waight of three ounces of the iuice thereof being drunke, is marueilous good to free vrine that hath long beene holden: and the herbe heated vpon a tile, and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with Malmeſey, and applied to the forehead, is very good for ſuch as are troubled with grauell, and cannot make water. The iuice thereof held within the mouth, healeth the toothach. The diſtilled water thereof clenſeth and clarifieth the viſage: the leaues being applied, heale burnings, ſwellings, and inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being fried with freſh butter, or capons greaſe, and laide in manner of a ſerge-cloth vpon the belly, they eaſe the colicke. A cataplaſme alſo made of greene pellitorie beaten with crums of bread, and oyle of roſes, or cammomill, reſolueth impoſtumes which grow in the dugs. And being mixed with goates-greaſe, or kids greaſe, it is good for gouts and fals. The iuice likewiſe mixed in like quantitie of white wine, and oile of ſweet almonds being newly made, alayeth the paines &amp; torments of the ſtone; and dropped into the eares with oyle of roſes, it healeth the paine of them. Some miniſter them to gargle for inflammation in the throat. And ſome giue them for an old cough. It is ſeene by experience that this herbe is abſterſiue, in ſo much as it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good to expell wormes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Fumitory.</note>Fumitorie is an herbe much branched and tender, hauing verie ſmall leaues growing here and there, of a white aſhie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and in great number vpon euerie ſide. The flower thereof is purple. This plant is one of the moſt gentle medicines, and leaſt annoying, that may be amongſt laxatiue remedies. But it is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where ſo common that none eſteeme of it. It is not only laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, but doth alſo fortifie the interiour members, bindeth their veines which are too looſe; as alſo thoſe of the ſtomacke, and of the liuer, and healeth feuers that proceed by choler, or through ſtoppings. It euacuateth the cholerike humour verie much in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:8737:184"/>
vrine: the ſeed thereof is bitter and ſomewhat ſharpe: and it is ſomewhat more hot, then the herbe that is temperate: ſo that the whole plant is purifying, penetratiue, opening and laxatiue. And becauſe of the cold and ſtiptick qualitie thereof it bindeth, reſtrayneth and fortifieth. It doth gently looſen the belly, it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth choler and burning humours. Wherefore it is good againſt the meazels, againſt cankers, and all infections of the skin, and other maladies which doe proceed from oppilations: the iuice thereof cleereth the ſight, &amp; cauſeth teares to iſſue euen as ſmoke or fume doth, whereof it ſeemeth to haue taken name.</p>
                  <p>Angelica is a moſt excellent plant,<note place="margin">Of Angelica.</note> and verie worthie to bee here deſcribed. It is aboue a cubit in height, it produceth a knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſtalke, creſted, and full of pits, the leaues thereof are long, and indented round about; the flowers white growing in bunches, out of which ſpringeth a little graine, and ſmooth like a lentill. The roote is as thicke as a reddiſh; diuided into many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſharpe in taſte, and ſweete in ſmell. Alſo there are ſundry ſorts thereof: for one kinde is ſet in gardens, another ſort is wild, and another groweth in watrie places. All this plant is hot and drie in the ſecond degree full, or to the beginning of the third: Wherefore it is opening, attenuating, and reſoluing. It is ſingular againſt poyſons: ſo that taken in drinke, or often che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, it preſerueth from the plague; being taken alone, it atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth flegmaticke and clammie humours. And ſo doth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the roote thereof, which doth readily heale the cough that comes through cold: for it cauſeth one to ſpit out and voide all clammie fleame. The ſame decoction receiued in wine or water, healeth vlcers in the interior members, diſſolueth clotted blood, and fortifieth the ſtomacke. The roote beaten to powder is ſoueraigne againſt fainting of the hart &amp; other paſſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. It is ſingular againſt bitings of mad &amp; venimous beaſts; being laid thereupon with Rue, or taken inwardly: for which cauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our moderne phiſitions imploy it in their counterpoiſons &amp; preſeruatiues. There is giuen halfe a dram of the root, with a dram of treacle, and the diſtilled water hereof, to ſuch as haue the plague, who are conſtrained to ſweat; and ſeuen howers after to reſume this drink: and by this onely counterpoiſon ſome haue beene holpen. This roote chewed, and put into holow teeth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwageth the paine of them. It alſo ſweetneth the breath. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall hold a little peece thereof in his mouth, or in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

drinke two ſpoonefuls of wine wherein it hath beene ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, hee ſhall not eaſily bee infected with euill aire all day after. The leaues thereof with the leaues of Rue and honie, applied in a cataplaſme, heale the bitings of madde-dogs, and ſtingings of ſerpents. And being laide vpon his head that is ſicke of an ague, it attracteth to it ſelfe much of the heate of the ague.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haire.</note>Maidenhaire alſo is a very exquiſite plant, much like vnto ferne, but with ſmaller leaues, ſet in order heere and there one ouer againſt another, in fine ſmal branches, ſharpe in taſte, black, and ſhining. It is temperate in heate and coldenes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it drieth, purifieth, and reſolueth: It is good to cauſe one ſpit and voide out of the breaſt and lungs, all groſſe and clammy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: It ſtaieth the fluxe of the belly, reſolueth the kings euill, and other tumors, and being taken in drinke is ſingular for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of water, when one can make it but drop by drop, &amp; it brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſtone. The decoction alſo thereof is good for them that draw their breath with paine, and is profitable for the ſpleene, and againſt the iaundiſe. And the herbe thereof being laid vpon the bitings of ſerpents, is a ſingular remedie therefore. To open alſo the infuſion thereof made in parſley water, or in endiue wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or in broth of blacke chich-peaſe, or in a little goats-milke, is very good: and adding ſugar thereto, it healeth inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſide, &amp; doth greatly prouoke vrine.

                  <p>SIth that it is not our purpoſe to write an entire Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie concerning ſimples, but onely to conſider of the moſt excellent in their effects, me ſeemeth that it is ſufficient for vs (ſo to make way to another matter) to adde to our precedent diſcourſes, that which I intend nowe to ſpeake concerning ſome ſingular plants: amongſt which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre Rheubarb to the firſt place, which is very plentifull in all India. The leaues of it are commonly two foote long, broad
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:8737:185"/>
aboue, and ſo growing narrower towards the ſtalke,<note place="margin">Of Rheubarb, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent virtue thereof.</note> hauing a certaine cotton or (as it were) haire round about it, as is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſeene in the herb called in French <hi>(Bouillon blane.)</hi> The ſtalk ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is but a foote high, or little more, and is all greene like the leaues. In the middle thereof groweth out a very ſmall branch, hauing certaine flowers about it that enuiron it, which are like vnto purple violets ſaue in colour onely, which is different be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing white and blew, of ſharpe ſmell, and very vnpleaſant to their noſe that ſmell thereat. The roote is very deepe in the ground, of a foote and an halfe long, and as thicke as a mans arme, ſome more, ſome leſſe; and out of it there do many ſmall ones ſprout, which (before the great one be cut) are digged vp with the principall, to the end that it may more eaſily be cleft in peeces. It is on the outſide of an aſhie colour, and full of yellowiſh iuice, while it is freſh and greene, and ſo clammie, that in touching thereof it cauſeth the fingers to ſticke togither. Now this roote is an excellent medicine, gentle, and without danger, wherein many ſingularities requiſite in a laxatiue ſimple are compriſed. And Rheubarb is beſt while it is greene, of a blackiſh colour, ſomewhat enclining to a redde, and heauie, although it be of a rare bodie, and which being broken, is mixed with red and skie colour within: and being chewed, waxeth as yellow as Saffron. Beſides it purgeth choler and flegme: it clenſeth and fortifieth the ſtomacke and liuer, and healeth the paines and prickings of them. It clarifieth the bloud, openeth and healeth all maladies that proceed of ſtoppings, as the iaundiſe, the dropſie, ſwelling of the ſpleene, and long feauers. It is good againſt ſpitting of bloud, and ſtancheth it, out of what part ſo euer it runne. And it may be taken at all times without danger, and in all ages, yea it may be miniſtred to little children, and to great bellied women: although the vulgar people thinke otherwiſe, ſuppoſing that Rheubarb is a very violent medicine, and that Phiſitions vſe it but in halfe deſpaired maladies: which is not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Licorice is verie woorthie to be numbred amongſt the moſt excellent Phiſicke plants. And thereof are two kinds,<note place="margin">Of Licorice.</note> one bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fruite, and the other not: that which beareth fruite, groweth abundantly in Germanie, and in the territorie of Bamberg and other places. And it is a verie branchie plant, of two cubits high, being thicke of leaues, and fatte in manner of gum: the flowers thereof are like an Hyacinth: the fruite thereof great like plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:8737:186"/>
berries, and more rough and hairie, encloſed within little cods, like thoſe of lentiles, hairie alſo and full of ſmal prickles, of yellow colour enclining to a blacke. The other kinde of Lico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice is very well knowne, and groweth of it ſelfe in many places. In vertue it is abſterſiue, clenſing, and alaieth the bitterneſſe of humors: and therefore it is very good for heate of the vrine. Being chewed, eſpecially whileſt it is freſh, it ſtancheth hunger and thirſt, and retayneth that vertue for many daies. And the iuice thereof being made thicke and held in the mouth, till it melt of it ſelfe, hath the ſame effect. It is good for the breaſt and lungs; and is therefore miniſtred to thoſe who haue ſhort breath, or are in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumption or pleuriſie. The iuice aſlwageth the pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, not onely of the arterie of the lungs, but of the bladder alſo: and doth excellently ſtaunch thirſt, as being tempered with moyſture, and colder then our nature. And it is to be noted, that the roote wherein lye all theſe properties is much better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh taken out of the ground, then when it is drie, and is more pleaſant in taſte being employed in medicines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Aloes.</note>The Aloë is a plant, which is ſeene greene in many townes in Italie, in windowes, and galleries: it is kept in pots full of earth, more for pleaſure to content the eie, then for vſe in medicine. But the licour and iuice that is preſſed out of it and brought to vs, is extracted out of the Aloë that groweth in the lower Syria, and Arabia, and in the Indies, where the beſt is. This plant hath thick and fat leaues, with certaine little prickles here and there on all ſides. The root thereof is fat and oilie, bearing a white flower, out of which groweth a litle graine, like that of Smallage. In the thick iuice thereof prepared for medicine there is found grauell and earth, which is nothing but the ſetlings of pure Aloes: but the good is pure and cleane, not ſophiſticate, without grauel, or little ſtones, reddiſh, brittle, of a good ſmell, cloſe like a liuer, and very much enclining to the colour thereof, eaſilie melting, and very bitter: that which is black, and hard to breake is worth nothing. The Aloë is profitable for many things becauſe of the drines thereof without any ſharpnes. It purgeth choler and fleame, the head, and ſtomach, and is very good for paines in thoſe parts, it quickneth all the ſenſes, openeth the liuer, and healeth the Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. It killeth wormes in the bellie, beeing incorporated with ox gall, and vineger, and laid vpon the nauell. Some apply the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof to wonnds to ſearch them; it healeth vlcers, and ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:8737:186"/>
them. It appeaſeth the paine of the head, beeing applied to the temples, &amp; forehead with vineger, and oile of roſes. In briefe the propertie thereof is to reſtraine, to dry, to prouoke ſleepe, to binde the bodie, and yet to looſen the bellie.</p>
                  <p>Sene hath leaues like Licorice, thick, fat,<note place="margin">Of Sene.</note> and in taſt like beanes: the ſtalke thereof is a cubit high, out of which iſſue many branches as pliable as a leatherne thong. The flowers thereof are yealow, ſtraked with ſmall purple ſtrakes; after which there grow certaine cods crooked like a ſickle, wherein is encloſed a black ſeede, enclining to greene, very like to kernels in grapes. It is ſowed in diuers places in Florence, and proſpereth very well, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the territory of the city of Florence; but the beſt is brought from Alexandria in Egypt, and out of Syria. It purgeth without any annoiance, choler, fleame, and melancholie. It mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difieth the hart, the liuer, the braine, the ſpleene, the lungs, and all parts of the bodie, and is profitable for all the accidents of them. It openeth the inner parts, and maintaineth a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in youth, forſloweth age, and cauſeth ioy of minde. The leaues thereof are good to waſh the head with cammomill; for they fortifie the braine, the ſinewes, the ſight, and the hearing. Briefly it is a good medicine in all long diſeaſes, and ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of a melancholie humour. And therefore it is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them that raue, and are out of their wits: likewiſe for vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ouer all the body, for palſies, for the head-ach, and falling euill. It fortifieth the hart eſpecially, beeing mixed with ſome other ingredient fit therefore, as namely with purple violets. It is very good in the infuſion or decoction thereof to ad ſome clones thereto, to correct a little that annoiance, which ſome ſay it doth to the ſtomach, and to fortifie the vertue thereof. And beeing mixed with ſome infuſion of roſes, or laxatiue ſirup of roſes, it is an excellent purge for all euill humours. There is a ſirup made of Sene, beeing taken greene from the plant, and mixed with infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of roſes, which is very good to that effect: and is ſo gentle that one may miniſter thereof to women with childe, and to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle infants, and people of all ages.</p>
                  <p>Saffron is a common plant, and yet hath many vertues.<note place="margin">Of Saffron.</note> It bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many leaues, long, narrow, ſmall, full, not round, hanging downewards, thick, and ſoft. The flower thereof is skie coloured, and very faire to behold. Out of the middle thereof growe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine red threedes, big at the top: with which out of the ſame
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:8737:187"/>
place almoſt, there growe other yealow ones in faſhion like toongs. That Saffron is good, which dieth your hands with the colour thereof, and that ſmelleth ſomewhat ſharp, and is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brittle. In propertie it is good for feeblenes of ſtomack, and faintnes of hart, beeing taken in ſome ſmall quantitie it preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth from drunkennes, and healeth the bitings of ſerpents, and ſtinging of ſpiders. It is reſtoratiue, the aſtriction thereof verie much aiding thereto: which qualitie proceedeth from cold and earthines, although that the qualitie of heat exceede therein: in ſuch ſort as in all the ſubſtance thereof, it is hot in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and dry in the firſt. But the ſmell thereof is naught for the head, and being taken too much it troubleth the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Century.</note>Centurie is likewiſe worthie of great conſideration, becauſe of the properties thereof in phiſicke. There be two ſorts of it, one is called great Centurie: and the other is leſſer Centurie. The great hath leaues like a walnut tree, long, greene like Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorts, indented about, a ſtalke of two or three cubits high. The flower thereof is blew, and the roote verie big, full of iuice, ſharp with aſtriction and ſweetnes. The leſſer ſore hath leaues like rue, a ſquare ſtalke, ſomewhat more then a ſpan long: the flowers thereof are red, inclining to purple; and the root is ſmall, ſmooth and bitter in taſte. For their properties, the vertue of great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turie conſiſteth in the roote thereof, which ſerueth for ruptures, conuulſions, difficultie in breathing, old coughes, pleuriſies, and ſpitting of blood.

                  <p>AMongſts herbs and plants, wherewith men are fed and nouriſhed, the chiefe degree is by good right aſſigned to wheat, as to that graine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the beſt bread is made, which onely with water, may very well ſuffice for the mainteinance of our life: hauing many properties alſo in the vſe of phiſick. Now according to the diuerſitie of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein it groweth people do name it; and one ſort differeth from another; but wee will heere ſpeake of that which is moſt common amongſt vs. All wheat hath many verie ſmall roots,<note place="margin">Of Wheat, and of the forme, and fertilitie thereof.</note> but one leafe; and many buds, which may diuide themſelues into ſundry branches. All the winter time it is an herb, but the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waxing milder, there ſpringeth out of the midſt thereof a ſmall ſtalk, which after three or foure knots or ioints, beareth an eare, not by and by ſeene, but is hidden within a caſe. The ſtalke beeing made, the flower bloometh ſome foure or fiue daies after, and about ſo long endureth. That paſt, the graine ſwelleth, and ripeneth in forty daies, or ſooner, as the climate is in heat. The fertility of this plant is meruailous, as wee behold by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. For there are ſome places in Italie eſpecially in the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Sienna, about the ſea coaſts, where there hath beene ſeene to grow out of one only graine foure and twenty eares of corne, and that one buſhell of ſeede hath yeelded an hundred. The beſt wheat ſhould bee hard to breake, maſſiue, waightie, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of gold, cleere, ſmooth, &amp; kept three moneths ripe, faire, and growing in a fat ſoile, to be the fitter to make better bread of. And the meale alſo muſt not be too much ground, neither yet too freſh, nor too long kept before it be vſed: for if it be too much ground, it maketh bread as if it were of branne; that which is too freſh doth yet retaine therein ſome heat of the mill-ſtone: and that which is kept too long will be ſpoyled either by duſt, or by mouldines, or will elſe haue ſome bad ſmell. Now beſides the common vſe of wheat, the manner how to make it in drinke is verie notable, which drinke ſerueth inſteed of wine in thoſe countries, where the vine cannot fructifie.<note place="margin">Beere.</note> For there they take
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:8737:188"/>
wheat, and ſometimes barley, rie, or oates, euerie one apart; or elſe two or three ſorts of theſe graines, or elſe all mingled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſteepe them in fountaine water, or in water of the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and cleereſt riuer that may be choſen: or elſe for better in a decoction or wourt of hops, and this is done for ſo long time till the graine begin to breake: then is it dried in the ſunne: being drie, it is beaten, or elſe ground; afterwards ſodden in water, in which it hath firſt beene ſteeped for the ſpace of three or fower howers, putting thereto a good quantitie of the flowers of hops, and skimming the decoction or wourt verie well: that done, it is powred out, and put in veſſels for the purpoſe. This drinke is called Beere: And they which will haue it verie pleaſant to the taſte, after it is made, doe caſt into the veſſels ſugar, cinamom, and cloues, and then ſtirre it verie much. Some doe put cockle into the compoſition of beere, the more to ſharpen the taſte. And ſith we are entred into this ſpeech, we will here note, that wheat doth eaſily conuert into cockle chiefly when the weather is rainie and cold:<note place="margin">Of Cockle.</note> for it commeth of corne corrupted by too much moiſture, or that hath beene too much wet by continuall raines in winter. It ſpringeth firſt out of the ground, hauing a long leafe, fat, &amp; rough, with a ſlenderer ſtalk then that of wheat, at the top whereof there is a long eare, hauing on all ſides little ſharpe cods or huskes, out of which three or fower graines grow together being couered with a verie hard barke. The bread that hath much thereof in it doth dizzie and hurt the head, ſo that they which eat thereof do commonly fall into a ſound ſleep, and their head is much troubled. It annoyeth the eies and dimmeth the ſight. Some alſo do make (<note n="*" place="margin">As ſome thinke wafer-cakes.</note>
                     <hi>Amylum</hi>) of wheat, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for many things. They take verie cleane wheat of three moneths olde, which they wet fiue times a day, and as often by night, if it be poſſible; being well ſoaked and ſteeped, they powre the water away, not ſhaking it to the ende that the thick, and that which is like creame may not runne out with the water. After that it is verie wel mollified, and the water changed, it muſt be ſifted, that the bran which ſwimmeth at top thereof may bee done away, and then muſt it be kneaded verie hard together ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting freſh water ſtil vpon it. And ſo it muſt be laid in panniers or doſſers to drie, and then vpon new tiles to be parched in the ſun, with as much ſpeed as may be: for if it remaine neuer ſo little a while moiſt, it waxeth ſowre. The beſt is that which is white,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:8737:188"/>
freſh, light and ſmooth. It hath power to mollifie in ſharpe and rough things: and is good againſt rheumes that fall into the eies. Being taken in drinke, it reſtraineth ſpitting of blood, and aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the ſorenes of the throat.</p>
                  <p>Next after Wheat, Rie is in common vſe to make bread of.<note place="margin">Of Rie.</note> This plant hath many ſtalkes ſmaller then thoſe of wheat, and blacker, as the graine is alſo. Meale made of Rie is good for plaiſters to draw. The decoction of the ſeede voideth wormes out of the belly, eſpecially if Coriander ſeed be mixed therewith. The ſtraw being ſoaked in water is good to binde vines inſteed of ruſh or broome.</p>
                  <p>Barley is alſo much vſed euerie where.<note place="margin">Of Barley.</note> It beareth a broad leafe, and rougher then wheat, &amp; hath a britler and leſſer ſtalk of eight knots, with one onely rough broad leafe vpon the ſtalke. The graine is lapped in a cod, which is cloſe ſhut: out of the top whereof groweth a long and ſharpe beard. The beſt is that which is whiteſt, moſt full, heauie, eaſie to boyle, not waxing mouldie. There groweth a certaine kinde of it in many places; the graine whereof is eaſily taken out of the huske or cod, and is therefore called clenſed Barley. Beſides, all barley drieth and cooleth, and is alſo abſterſiue. The meale thereof boyled in honied-water with figs, reſolueth al inflammations and impoſtumes: with roſin and pigeons dung, it ripeneth all hard ſwellings: with melilot &amp; heads of poppie, it eaſeth the paine of the ſides; and with quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or vineger, it appeaſeth inflammations of the goute in the feete. The aſhes of burnt barley is verie good for burnings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laide thereupon, and applied to fleſh that cleaueth not to the bone. Concerning barley-bread, beſides that it lyeth heauie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtomacke, it engendreth alſo cold and clammie humours: it nouriſheth little, cauſeth windines; and yet ſome ſay it is very good for them that haue the gout in their feet.<note place="margin">Of Beere.</note> There is a certain kind of drink called Beere made of barley, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vſed inſteed of wine in al the north-countries, to wit in Germany, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, Polonia, Fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, &amp; other cold countries of Europe. And if one take too much therof, it wil inebriate or make dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ken as wel as wine, &amp; that for a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger time, bicauſe that beere is more groſſe and materiall, and of harder digeſtion then wine: whereto it is ſo like alſo in force and vertue, that aqua-vitae is likewiſe made thereof. Next after barley, oates are a graine very commodious.<note place="margin">Of Oates.</note> In leafe and ſtalke this graine reſembleth wheate; but it beareth
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:8737:189"/>
on the top thereof as it were little twolegd graſhoppers, hanging where the graine is incloſed: which though it ſeeme to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of nature rather fit for beaſts foode, then for man: yet in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie they oftentimes eate it in good fat fleſh pottage, being boiled therein after it hath beene cleanſed of all filth, as is vſed in rice. Oates alſo in the vſe of phiſicke doe very neere approch to the qualitie of Barley: For being applied, it drieth, and moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolueth. But it is a little more cold, and ſomewhat more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent in temper, ſo that it is good for the flux in the belly, and profitable for thoſe that haue the cough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Rice.</note>Wee may likewiſe conſider of Rice, which the Ancients did hold to bee a kinde of corne. The leafe thereof is very thick, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of a leeke. The ſtalke thereof is about a cubit long, knotty, bigger then that of wheat, and ſtronger: on the top of it groweth an eare parted into little branches, on both ſides where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the graine included, in a yealow huske, rough, and hauing creuiſes on the ſide, of an ouall figure, and beeing taken out of the huske it becommeth white. It groweth in ſome places of Italie in moiſt ground: but it aboundeth in Aſia, Syria, and Egypt. Rice is very vſuall in meat, and nouriſheth meanely: but it is made of more e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3+ letters">
                        <desc>•••…</desc>
                     </gap> digeſtion, and of better taſt beeing ſod in cowes-milk, almond milke, or fat fleſh pottage. It is very good to giue to ſuch as haue the laxe, and colick. The flower thereof is good in repercuſſiue plaiſters. It ſtaieth inflammations that riſe in the dugs. The decoction of Rice alſo is very profitable in cliſters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt laxes or fluxes, and in drinke likewiſe. Now to end this talke,<note place="margin">Of Millet.</note> wee will ſay ſomething concerning Millet, for it hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny properties both in food and phiſick. This plant beareth leaues like thoſe of a reed, hauing a ſtalke of a cubit long, thick, knottie, and rough. At the top thereof do hang certaine hairie heads in which the graine groweth in great abundance, beeing round, maſſiue, yealow, and lapped in a thin skin. In many places bread is made of this graine, and euen at Verona it is carried hot about the ſtreets, whereof they make much account; for it hath a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes very pleaſant to the taſt, if it bee eaten a little after it is drawne out of the ouen: but beeing hard it is vnpleaſant. The common people of Trent, are nouriſhed with Millet boiled one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eating it with milke, and it is the beſt food that they can get. Beſides, there are very good fomentations or ſerge-clothes made of Millet, to dry moderately, and to driue out ventoſities, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:8737:189"/>
beeing mixed with ſalt. It is happily applied againſt griping in the bellie cauſed through windines: but it is much better yet beeing mingled with flowers of Cammomill. It is commonly fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a pan, and then put hot into a bag, and ſo laid vpon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed parts. It hath the vertue to preſerue medicines long time from moulding and putrifying, if they bee buried in an heape of Millet: yea and freſh fleſh is long kept thereby in hot weather. Now to finiſh this daies diſcourſe, it ſeemeth good to me (ACHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOB) that you ſpeake of the vine and fruit thereof, of which men make their moſt delicious drinke.</p>

                  <p>IT were very ſuperfluous to make here a long diſcourſe concerning the Vine, and concerning the diuers qualities which are found in this plant, of which wee doe not onely receiue Grapes (a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and delicious meat) but haue alſo that moſt exquiſite drinke which wee call wine: for all the world hath ſo much cheriſhed the vine, that there are few people of any condition ſoeuer, but can diſcourſe ſufficiently well of it, and of the nature thereof.<note place="margin">Property of the Vine.</note> We will briefly then declare that which wee ſhall thinke moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therein, and chiefly in the vſe of medicine. The leaues, and tender branches thereof helpe the head-ach, beeing laid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and appeaſe inflammations and heat of the ſtomack. The iuice of them drunke ſerue againſt Dyſenterias, or fluxes, ſpitting of bloud, weakenes of ſtomack, and the corrupt appetite of great bellied women. The licour of vines, which lieth thick vpon the ſtock thereof like gum, beeing taken in drinke with wine, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth grauell. The aſhes of the branches and ſtones, beeing mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vineger, helpeth the hard bindings of the fundament, and is good againſt the ſtingings and bitings of vipers, and againſt inflammation of the ſpleene, beeing laid thereupon with oile of Roſes, Rue, and vineger.</p>
                  <p>As grapes are the moſt ſingular fruits of Autumne;<note place="margin">Of Grapes.</note> ſo alſo are they the moſt nouriſhing of all the fruits of ſummer, which are not to bee kept; and they engender the beſt nouriſhment eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:8737:190"/>
when they bee perfect ripe. But all Raiſins do not nouriſh after one manner: for ſweete ones haue a more hot ſubſtance: and therefore they cauſe thirſt, do ſwell the ſtomacke, and looſen the belly. Contrariwiſe, tart ones doe binde, doe nouriſh little, and are of hard digeſtion. Greene and ſowre ones are naught for the ſtomacke. And the bigger grapes are, the better they are, eſpecially if they be gathered verie ripe. They which are kept hanged vp are beſt for nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe their great moiſture is dried. The freſh &amp; verie ripe grape is good for burnings, if the wine thereof be preſt out betwixt ones hands vpon the hurt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The mother of the wine or grapes being kept, and mixed with ſalt, is profitable againſt inflammations of the dugs, &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them through too much abundance of milke. The decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof cliſterized, ſerueth greatly for dyſenterias or fluxes. The ſtones or ſeeds haue a reſtringent vertue, and are profitable for the ſtomacke. Being parched and beaten into powder, it is good to eate with meate againſt the fluxe, and weaknes of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. Drie grapes or raiſins haue yet greater vertues and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in the vſe of Phiſicke: and eſpecially they which are ſweeteſt, and of moſt ſubſtance, as they of Damaſcus, of Cypres, and of Candia. The meate of them being eaten is good for the cough, for the throat, the reines and the bladder: being eaten with their ſtones, they ſerue againſt dyſenterias. Being boyled in a platter with ſugar and flower of millet, of barley, and an egge, they purge the braine: being reduced into a plaiſter, with flower of beanes and cumin,<note place="margin">Propertie of dry Raiſins.</note> they appeaſe inflammations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the nouriſhment of raiſins is ſo diſtributed through the bodie according as their nature is, ſweete to the ſweete, ſowre to the ſowre, meane to them that participate with both qualities; and the ſweete, full and fat raiſins doe nouriſh more then the ſharpe and leane. They which are without ſtones, either by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or art, if they be ſweet, they are ſo depriued of all aſtriction, ſo that they be maruellous lenitiue. And therefore are they moſt fit for paines of the breaſt, for the cough, for ſore throats, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies in the reines and bladder, and are good alſo for the liuer. But we may not here forget to make mention of the fruit of the wilde Vine commonly called in French <hi>(Lambruſque)</hi> becauſe of the admirable properties thereof. The grapes of it are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and put to drie in the ſhade: they are of a reſtringent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, good for the ſtomacke, and prouoke vrine: they binde the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:8737:190"/>
belly, and ſtay ſpitting of blood.</p>
                  <p>Now muſt wee ſpeake of Wine which is made of the Raiſin,<note place="margin">Of Wine, and the properties thereof.</note> and grape produced by the vine. Concerning it many affirme, that it is the moſt ſweete licour of all others, the principall aide, and chiefe prop of humaine life, the chiefe reſtorer of the vitall ſpirits, the moſt excellent ſtrengthener of all the faculties and actions of the body, reioicing &amp; comforting the hart very much: and for theſe cauſes they ſay that the Auncients haue called that plant, which beareth the fruit, out of which wee receiue this wine (Vitis quaſi Vita) life. But yet wee muſt not deceiue our ſelues by ſo many praiſes attributed to wine, conſidering that the vſe thereof by the leaſt exceſſe that may bee, doth bring ſo many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils vpon man, that they cannot bee numbred, nor ſufficientlie bewailed. But beeing vſed temperately, wee muſt confeſſe, that it is a thing of greateſt efficacie in the world, to nouriſh and ſtrengthen the bodie. For it engendreth very pure bloud, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quickly conuerted into nouriſhment, it helpeth to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion in all parts of the bodie, it giueth courage, purgeth the braine, refreſheth the vnderſtanding, reioiceth the hart, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſpirits, prouoketh vrine, driueth out ventoſities, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth naturall heat, fatneth them who are in good health, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth the appetite, purifieth troubled bloud, openeth ſtoppings, conuaieth the nouriture throughout the whole body, maketh good colour, and purgeth out of the bodie all that which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuperfluous. But if wine bee taken without great mediocritie and temperance, it doth by accident refrigerate the whole bodie. For the naturall heat thereof by too much drinke remaineth choaked, euen as a little fire is quenched by a great heap of wood caſt thereupon. Beſides, wine is hurtfull for the braine, for the marrow of the back bone, and the ſinewes that grow out of it. Whereby it falleth out, that this principall part beeing hurt, there ſucceede in time, great and dangerous maladies thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, the apoplexie, the falling euill, the palſie, ſhakings, numbnes of members, conuulſions, giddines of the head, ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ioints, the incubus, the catalepſia, lethargie, frenſie, rheumes, deafenes, blindenes, and ſhrinking of mouth and lips. Moreouer wine immoderately drunke corrupteth all good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and diſcipline of life. For this is it that makes men quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, wranglers, raſh, incenſed, furious, dice-plaiers, adulterers, homicides, in a word addicted to all vice, and diſſolution. Beſides
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:8737:191"/>
it is to be noted, that wine is fitter for old people, then for them of other ages: for it moderateth and mantaineth the cold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of ancient folkes, which hath come vpon them for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres.<note place="margin">Of the vſe of Wine.</note> But it ſhould not be ſufferable (if we will follow the counſell of the elders) for children and yoong folkes to drinke thereof, till they attaine to the age of twentie yeeres. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is as much as to put fire to fire. And yet if we would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the counſell of the Sages, it ſhould not be drunke at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in certaine indiſpoſitions which might happen to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, according as the vſe was in times paſt in Greece, namely at Athens, where wine was onely ſold in Apothecaries ſhops, as Aqua-vitae now is. But aboue all, heed muſt be taken that in the great heat of the yeere, wine bee not drunke that is cooled by ſnow, yee, or verie cold water, as we ſee by great curioſitie done among vs. For it greatly hurteth the braine, the ſinewes, the breaſt, the lungs, the ſtomacke, the bowels, the ſpleene, liuer, reines, bladder, and teeth. And therefore it is no maruell, if they which ordinarily vſe it, are in time tormented with the colicke and paine of the ſtomacke: alſo with conuulſions, palſies, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, difficultie in breathing, reſtrainment of vrine, ſtoppings of the inward members, the dropſie, and many other great and dangerous diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Aquauitae, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how to diſtill it.</note>It reſteth for concluſion of this diſcourſe, that wee ſay ſomewhat concerning wine diſtilled through a limbecke in a bathe of water, which the Sages haue called for the admirable vertues thereof (Water of Life.) For to make which: Take of the beſt wine a certaine quantitie according to the veſſel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you will diſtill it, and that fill to the third part of the pot or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: then couer it with the head thereof verie well cloſed, ſo that no vapour may iſſue out, ſet it vpon the furnace ouer a moderate fire, in ſuch ſort that the wine boyle not. And to haue verie good Aqua-vitae, you muſt diſtill it fower or fiue times and more: for the more it is rectified, the perfecter it will be. And in the firſt diſtillation it is ſufficient to receiue the tenth part of the wine put into the limbeck: for the ſecond the halfe; for the third ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moitie or leſſe: ſo that the oftner you diſtill, the leſſer you haue, but better alwaies. Now you may know whether Aqua-vitae haue attained to full perfection, by theſe ſignes: [If it ariſe to the like quantitie of water, or verie neere, as the liquor put in: if being lighted or ſet on fire it burne al away, and leaue not any
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:8737:191"/>
marke of moyſture in the bottome of the veſſell: if a doth being dipt therein, and lighted, will not burne at all: if a drop of oyle being caſt therein ſinke to the bottom; and if a drop of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpilt in the palme of your hand, doe preſently conſume and euaporate.] Now the vertues and properties of this Aqua-vitae, are verie many. For as it preſerueth from all corruption thoſe things which haue beene ſteeped therein: ſo all corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done away, it keepeth, repaireth, mantaineth, augmenteth, and prolongeth the life of thoſe that receiue it. And it doth not onely preſerue the naturall heat, and mantaine it in vigour; but it alſo regenerateth the vitall ſpirit; quickneth and warmeth the ſtomacke, ſharpneth the braine and vnderſtanding, cleereth the ſight, repaireth the memorie, eſpecially if they vſe it, who are of a cold temper, being ſubiect to rawnes of ſtomacke, windines, and other cold maladies. Thus then haue we declared enough concerning the plants and fruits which the earth produceth for the commoditie of man. Wherefore, we will to morrow conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the diuerſitie of terreſtriall creatures created to the ſame ende, that we may be the more induced to glorifie him, from whom we receiue all theſe benefits.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing this day to diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning liuing creatures of the Earth, ſo much as the ſubiect of our ſpeech doth require for the accompliſhment of our worke: It behooueth vs to conſider that the terreſtriall beaſts, being as it were innumerable in the ſpecies; yet they conſiſt of two principall kindes: to wit, of Inſect, and of perfect beaſts. They of the firſt kinde are called of the Latins by this word <hi>(Inſecta)</hi> becauſe of the inciſions which appeere vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their bodies, retayning life in that part, which we behold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and cut off: and they are engendred for the moſt part of putrefaction; but theſe things agree not with perfect creatures, who take their forme in the matrice. Now we will here ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily entreat of Inſect animals generally, and conſequently of the moſt excellent of their kinde, whereof ſome creepe vpon the earth,<note place="margin">Of Inſect beaſts.</note> as ſerpents; &amp; others fly, as flies. We are firſt then to note that all inſect beaſts are wilde, and are verie hardly tamed and made milde: for they haue their inner ſenſes verie weak; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſuch creatures as are made tame and familiar, muſt haue the facultie of imagination and good memorie. Moreouer, theſe kindes of beaſts haue little blood, or none at all, as Philoſophers hold, who finde in them a certaine vitall humour onely, which Nature hath giuen them inſteed of blood: for which cauſe they are naturally fearfull; and feare hindreth creatures from being tamed. Likewiſe they haue commonly but ſhort life: and beaſts, who ſhould be made familiar, require time for that purpoſe. Furthermore, in this kinde of Inſect beaſts ſome are engendred onely of putrefaction, as flies: others of egs, as ſerpents: and alſo by another manner, which is perfected in the matrice by egs, as
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:8737:192"/>
the viper. Now in al this kind of beaſts, they are moſt admirable, which we haue heere named, to wit: ſerpents, becauſe of their greatnes and puiſſant effects, and hony-flies or bees, and ſilke-wormes alſo, becauſe of their worke.</p>
                  <p>But amongſt the many kindes of ſerpents,<note place="margin">Of the Aſpis.</note> the Aſpis or Adder is very worthie of conſideration, and much to bee feared: for there are three ſorts, each whereof cauſeth him that is bitten by them ſoone to die, except he bee quickly and very well ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. One ſort is named (Ptyas) another (Cherſaea) both earth-ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: and the third is called (Chelidonia) which abideth about banks of riuers, &amp; ſpecially of Nilus. The Ptyas, and Cherſaea are of aſhie and greene colour, drawing a little to the colour of gold. But the Chelidonia hath a blacke backe, and white belly like to ſwallowes. And both the one and the other ſort are of fiue cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits long in the regions of Africa. They raiſe vp their necke when they will caſt their venim; wherewith when one is attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their preſent remedie is ſpeedily to cut away all that which is bitten, or elſe it is hard to ſaue them from death: and yet many ſpeake of diuers remedies; and amongſt others they commend verie ſtrong vineger, aduiſing that it ſhould be giuen to the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to drinke, euen ſo much and for ſo long time till he feele the qualitie in the right ſide of his flanks: for they ſay that the liuer is firſt depriued of feeling in ſuch an accident. Some vſe Opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panax (a drug extracted out of Panaces Heracleum) which is giuen to drinke in wine mixed with water, to cauſe them vomit the venim alreadie ſpread throughout the whole bodie. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch vomiting they muſt take verie good treacle in drinke, and apply it alſo vpon the biting. <hi>Mattheolus</hi> deſcribeth a quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence,<note place="margin">In. Dioſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For indeed it is moſt certaine, that waters artificially compoſed, and ingeniouſly diſtilled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of moſt ſubtile parts, are in a moment diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the veines and arteries, and euerie part of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And therefore they cauſe, that the blood and ſpirits waxe not cold, and doe not congeale in thoſe veſſels which containe them: whereby alſo the naturall heat comming to augment it ſelfe, doth ſtrongly reſiſt the force of the venim, and doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſurmount it.</p>
                  <p>The Viper alſo is a kinde of ſerpent, it hath a flat head,<note place="margin">Of the viper.</note> and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:8737:193"/>
broad neere to the ioint of the necke, which is naturally ſmall, it hath a quicke eie, and a naile in the noſthrill thereof, hauing all the reſt of the bodie ſhort, with the taile alſo, and is of a pale co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Her pace and motion is verie quicke, and ſhe beareth her head aloft: ſhe differeth from other ſerpents, in that they lay but egs, and ſhe bringeth foorth her yoong ones aliue: which before they come foorth do ſo gnaw and eate her belly, that ſhe liueth not long after. And although the viper be verie venimous, yet is her fleſh verie good for the compoſition of treacle, yea though her venim remaine with her after death. Moreouer, the biting of the viper is as much, or more dangerous then that of the Aſpis: for they who are hurt die within ſeuen howers after, except they bee well ſuccoured; and at fartheſt within three daies, except they be holpen by excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t remedies; of which, amongſt others, this is good: cleane a chicken in two, and lay the inſide of her hot vpon the wound, and do oftentimes reiterate this order: ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the fleſh round about the biting, &amp; applying diuers times cupping glaſſes thereto. After which, you muſt giue the patient of the iuice of aſhtree leaues to drinke, and lay the ſame leaues vpon the wound, or elſe cammomill brayed, or a plaiſter made of barley meale, &amp; honied vineger. Some vſe bryar taken in drinke with wine; or the iuice of baulme leaues drunke alſo with wine. Some ſay alſo that the viper being flayed, hir taile, and head cut off, and her intrailes drawen out and caſt away, afterwards ſod like an eele, and eaten by him that hath bin bitten, doth greatly aide him to obtaine health. As treacle alſo being chiefly made of vipers fleſh, eaten, and applied to, is a ſingular remedie in ſuch accidents.</p>
                  <p>I could here diſcourſe of many other kindes of ſerpents: but it is not our intent to repreſent a perfect hiſtorie of liuing things, conſidering that many Authors haue written thereof for our learning.

                  <p>MAnie graue authors haue not diſdained, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to ſearch out, and curiouſly to deſcribe the hiſtorie of Bees, being chiefly mooued therunto through admiration of their cunning in compoſing two ſo excellent commodities as are hony &amp; waxe: we will here then deliuer that which we eſteeme to be moſt woorthie of note in their writings.<note place="margin">Of Bees.</note> Firſt Bees are ruſticke and wilde; or tame and familiar. And the wilde are more illfauored to beholde, more fierce and naught. Of the tame there are two kindes. One kinde are round and ſhort, and of diuers colours, and theſe are the beſt. The other are long and like to waſpes, and the woorſt of theſe are rough and hairie. All of them hate ſtincks and infections, and fly from them, for which cauſe they neuer ſting ſuch as are perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſweete odors. They neuer flie againſt the light, nor vpon any fleſh, nor to bloud, nor to any fat thing, but doe onely ſeek out leaues &amp; flowers, which haue an odoriferous iuice. They delight in harmonious ſounds and noiſes, whereby it commeth, that being ſcattered, they are aſſembled togither, by the ſounde of a baſon, or of ſome little bels, or by clapping the hands gently togither. They vſe great policie amongſt themſelues, and there is no ſwarme but hath a king and captaine, which is bigger then all the other Bees, and hath ſhort wings, ſtraight legs, a brauer march then all the reſt, with a ſpot in his forehead, which ſerueth as a Diademe or crowne, and is in euery part more ſlick, ſmooth, and faire then all the reſt. When hee goeth any whither, the whole troupe followeth, encompaſſing &amp; garding him, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that hee bee eaſily ſeene. And whileſt all are at worke, the king goeth from place to place cheering them, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth nothing elſe. He neuer commeth foorth except when the whole troupe goeth into the fieldes: which may be knowne certaine daies before by the noiſe which the Bees make within their hiues, attending for ſome faire day to part in. If the king looſe a wing, the troupe doth not forſake him: for alwaies euery one of them deſireth to be neere him, and to do him ſeruice. And
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:8737:194"/>
if he be wearie they helpe him on their ſhoulders: if tired, they carie him: and in what place ſoeuer he reſteth, all the ſwarme encampeth: If perhaps they looſe him, they eſtabliſh a new king of the race of the former, hauing alwaies diuers elected and knowne amongſt them to ſucceed thoſe that faile. For the reſt of their gouernment, their witte is no leſſe admirable then their worke, as is recorded to haue beene obſerued by <hi>Aristomachus Solenſis,</hi> who delighted himſelfe for 58. yeere togither to nouriſh diligently theſe little animals, ſo much he loued them, neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelfe to any other thing. By which kinde of meanes it was knowne that in the day time the Bees ward, and watch at the gate as in a campe, and reſt in the night till ſuch time as one amongſt them being as Sentinell, wakeneth them with two or three ſounds as it were of a trumpet. Then all of them aſſemble to ſee if it be faire weather: for they can iudge of the winds, and of the raine, and in foule weather they bouge not: but if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be faire and calme, all goe to worke. Some bring in their feete, that which they haue drawne out of flowers: others beare water in their mouth: and ſome againe helping them with a ſmal haire do lade themſelues with drops of water ouer all their body. The yoonger ſort go foorth to do theſe things, and the older tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell within the hiues, where their offices are appointed them. For ſome build others poliſh; this brings in matter, that victuals; another water, and all of them haue all things common, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue equalitie in meate and worke. They watch who are idle, and chaſtiſe and puniſh them euen ſometimes by death. Firſt they make their combes and waxe, whereof they builde their lodgings. After they be lodged, they conſider how to multiplie themſelues, and laſt of all they make their honie. And they haue this wittie induſtrie, to mixe in the matter, wherewith they firſt beſmeare or ouercaſt their hiues, the iuice of the moſt bitter herbes they can finde, to the end to put ſuch ſmall beaſts or flies out of taſte that woulde ſucke thereof; euen as if they had beene informed, that their worke was ſought after. In briefe all their manner of life, order and policie is euery way admirable.</p>
                  <p>But what may wee ſay particularly concerning their hony and wax,<note place="margin">Of Honie.</note> the vſe whereof is ſo commodious and profitable to man? It is certaine that theſe induſtrious creatures know how to chooſe and gather a kinde of dew, which falleth from heauen (at the riſing of certaine ſtars, eſpecially in the dog-daies) vpon the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:8737:195"/>
leaues of plants, whereof they make hony. And the beſt is that which is of a deepe yealow colour, and hath a pleaſant ſmell, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pure and neat, ſhining euery where, and ſweete in taſt, beeing alſo of a meane ſubſtance betweene liquid, and thick. In vertue it hath the propertie to hinder corruption, and rottennes: and therefore ſome make gargariſmes thereof to clenſe and mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the vlcers of the mouth. It preſerueth life eſpecially in thoſe that are of cold complexion: ſo we behold that the Bee, which is a feeble, and tender creature liueth nine or ten yeeres, becauſe ſhee is nouriſhed by honie. It is abſterſiue, opening, and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth humours. Beeing in time applied to any part of the bodie which is bruiſed by ſome blow, or fall, it is a ſingular remedy to heale any ſuch bruiſe; if ſo bee the skinne bee not broken. And the wax (which is made of the combes taken out of the hiues,<note place="margin">Of Wax.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they haue beene well preſſed, and that all the hony hath been drained out) is likewiſe of ſingular vtility for men. The beſt ſhould be very yealow, ſweete, fatte, light, pure, cloſe, euen, neat, and clenſed from all filth. It is of meane quality betwixt hot, cold, moiſt, and dry things, and is of a groſſe and clammie ſubſtance: retaining an hot and reſolutiue vertue, which alſo aboundeth in hony. It is miniſtred in drinke againſt Dyſenterias: but aboue all it is profitable in the compoſition of ointments, which are made for wounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of Silke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes.</note>Now let vs ſpeake of Silkewormes, which next to Bees merit moſt admiration amongſt all inſect beaſts. This worme is firſt bredde of another worme of the ſame kinde which hath hornes: for thereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a ſnaile, which afterwards produceth the ſilke worme called Bombyx, and by ſome Necydalus, which is like to a butterflie; and laieth egs through the copulation of the male and female; out of which egges in the end thoſe wormes creepe, who by ſo maruailous induſtrie do make vs our ſilke: that in a ſhort time is drawne out of their mouth by a ſmall threed, which afterward is weaued with ſuch wondrous art, that therein is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing broken, falſe, or vneuen, but euery whit perfect from the beginning to the end of euery bottome or clewe, beeing one faſtened to another. And that which maketh their labour ſeeme more wondrous, is, that theſe creatures are without fleſh, bloud, or bones; without vaines, ſinewes, or arteries; without ſcales, or any intrailes: as alſo outwardly they are ſeene to bee without teeth, nailes, prickles, or briſtles, haire, eies, or eares: and yet in
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:8737:195"/>
leſſe then fortie daies, how ſmall ſoeuer they bee when they are engendred, they become thick, and great; hauing the benefit of eating and ſleepe, and they caſt their skin foure times. And then their body beginneth to gliſter, oftentimes ſhewing the skeane of ſilke which is in their bellie, which if they muſt make white, they haue their head as white as ſiluer: if the ſilke muſt bee yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, their head wilbee like gold: if greene, or tawny, their head will beare the ſigne thereof. Then do they ſeeke where to faſten it, and ſo weaue their ſilke in order, till ſuch time as they haue performed their worke; which doth not onely ſerue for clothing for men, but for a ſingular remedie alſo to comfort a ſick-hart, to reioice it, and recreate ſadde, and melancholie ſpirits, as wee may acknowledge by that excellent confection, called of Phiſitions <hi>(Alkermes)</hi> which for the moſt part compounded of the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and infuſion of ſilke in the iuice of kermes, beeing drunke is a ſoueraigne medicine againſt faintnes and ſyncopes. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing already ſaid enough concerning Inſect beaſts, for the ſubiect of our diſcourſe, wee will conſequently ſpeake of ſome perfect beaſts, according as wee ſhall make choiſe of, as of the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to enrich our preſent worke, to the end, as wee haue decreed that the creator may bee glorified: whereof (ARAM) you muſt now entreate.</p>

Now there are many ſorts of dogs, all which we may comprehend vnder two kinds: the one is, of them which are to keepe houſe, and the other to chaſe withall.<note place="margin">Of the houſe-dogge.</note> The houſe-dogge ought to be of groſſe and bigge bodie, being ſquare ſet, and rather ſhort then long: his head great, his throate wide, thicke lips, bigge hanging eares, his eies blew and blacke, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:8737:196"/>
and ſparkling, his necke thicke and ſhort, his breſt large and rough, his ſhoulders broad, legs thicke and hairy, and a ſhort and thicke taile, which is a ſigne of force: (for the long and ſmall taile noteth ſwiftnes) his pawe and nailes great, his barking high, bigge and fearefull: aboue all vigilant and very watchfull, not running heere and there, but ſtaied, and more ſlowe then haſtie. Hunting hounds are of ſundrie ſorts.<note place="margin">Of Dogs for the chaſe.</note> They which are ſwift are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white or browne, or gray, or blacke. And the white are beſt: for they are well winded, quicke, fierce, &amp; wil not leaue the chaſe for any heat whatſoeuer, neither will breake off for the preaſe of hunters, nor for the noiſe and cry of men: and they obſerue change better then any other kinde of hound, and are more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: but they feare the water ſomewhat, eſpecially in winter-time. If they bee cleane white, or ſpotted with red, they are the better. The browne doth ſecond them, and are of a great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, forward, quicke and fierce, fearing neither water nor cold: but they cannot endure heate, and are not ſo eaſie to gouerne as the white. The graie are not ſo quicke and furious as the reſt; neither yet the blacke, who are commonly the biggeſt bodied. Yet there are good dogs of all haires and colours, but to chooſe a faire and good hound indeed, theſe ſignes muſt be obſerued. His head muſt be meanly thick, more long then flat: his noſthrils wide and open: eares broad, and reaſonable thicke: crooked reines: thicke loines; bigge and large hanches; faire thighes; the right hamme-ioint well knit; the taile thicke neere to the raines, and the reſt ſmall to the end: the haire vnder his bellie rough, a thicke legge, and the pawe of his foote drie, and like to the pawe of a foxe: great nailes, as high behinde as before: and the dogge muſt be ſhort and crooked, but the bitch muſt bee long. For open noſthrils declare the dogge to be well winded: crooked raines and ſtraight hams ſignifie quicknes: the taile thicke neere to the raines, long and ſmall to the end, denote ſtrength and force in the raines, and that the hound is well brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed: haire rough vnder the belly, declareth that he is painefull, fearing neither water nor colde: a thicke legge, foxes foote, and great nailes, demonſtrate that he is not heauie footed, and that he is ſtrong in members to runne long without tiring. Beſides houndes, there be grey-hounds, bloud hounds, water-ſpaniels, tumblers and mungrels, all which are of diuers kindes: but our meaning is not to ſet downe an entire narration thereof, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:8737:196"/>
that it is not neceſſarie for that purpoſe, which we haue decreed in our diſcourſes. Wherefore we will content our ſelues to note in generall, that there is no beaſt of greater ſenſe and loue, nor more docible then the dog. For there be few things fit for the pleaſure of man, but may he eaſily taught to this kinde of creatures, eſpecially in all points concerning hunting.

For theſe fower colours proceed of fower principall humors whereof the bodie of an horſe is compoſed, and which agree and accord with the fire, aire, earth and water.

The bay haire then excelleth all others, as beeing that which beareth the ſigne and marke of a couragious horſe: hardie in warre, and moſt ſingular in iuſts and combats, in ſo much as hee feareth nothing, nor looſeth courage, howſoeuer he feele himſelfe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: becauſe alſo hee ſeeth not, by reaſon of his colour, the bloud

Moreouer, by how much more theſe colours are diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified, and mixed with markes, and ſpots; by ſo much is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or badnes of the horſe greater.

But theſe generous beaſts doe eſpecially declare their valor and courage in the cruell encounters of battailes, and fights, beeing incited by the fearefull noiſe of gunſhot, by the hideous thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of cannons, by the ſounding of trumpets, and rumbling of drummes: then I ſay when all beeing in confuſion, it ſeemeth that the earth opens, that the place flies in peecs, and that hell ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes vp all, in reſpect of the ſhiuering of launces, clinking of armor, and the dreadfull cries of men, who are there, by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, hewen in pieces.

He is bigger then two great oxen, couered with black haire, hauing eies like to thoſe of ſwine, and ſuch a mouth alſo, beeing couered with a truncke, or ſnout that hangs downe to the ground, which ſerueth him for an hand to put his victuals into his mouth, both meate and drinke: and out of both ſides thereof two great tuskes do iſſue, which are faſtned in his vpper iaw. His eares are two ſpans broad, his thighs and legs thick and long, in ſuch ſort that ſome are found of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene foot high: his nailes (beeing fiue in number about his feete) are round, and each naile a palme broad, and his taile is about three handfuls long. In many regions of Africa they vſe theſe elephants to ride ordinarily vpon, and they ſerue for many do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick buſineſſes alſo, ſo that the trafficke of them there is as that of horſes here. But the Indians vſe them in the war, putting vpon this beaſt, a certaine ſaddle beeing girt very ſtreight about him with two iron chaines, vpon which they ſet two wooden

houſes, on either ſide one, and in each of thoſe houſes doe three men lodge, betweene which houſes and the elephants neck, is a little ſeat placed, vpon which a man ſitteth like as if hee were on horſe back, who guideth this beaſt by his words, which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth very well: and he carrieth neither bridle, nor halter, nor any thing elſe vpon his head. And euen as they, which are within theſe houſes vpon his back are armed with coats of maile, with bowes, launces, ſwords, and targets: ſo likewiſe will he bee coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a maile eſpecially vpon his head, and ſnout, to which men faſten a ſword of two fadomes in length, thick, and as broad as a mans hand, wherewith this beaſt doth helpe himſelfe in fight. In all things elſe he is of incredible force. For <hi>Lewes de Barthema</hi> in the diſcourſes of his Indie voiages doth teſtifie that he did ſee three elephants alone draw a ſhip out of the ſea, and ſet it a land, after the people had gotten vnder it three great wedges of wood.

                     <hi>Plinie</hi> recordeth many other wonders concerning theſe beaſts, ſaying, that they honour the ſtars, and principally the ſunne and moone; that ſome haue beene ſeene, who beeing ſicke, haue fallen downe back-wards, caſting vp herbes towards heauen, as if they would offer vp the fruits of the earth in ſacrifice, and praier to obtaine ſuccour from aboue: that all of them doe honour a king, and fall downe vpon their knees before him, and that they bring chaplets of hearbes, and flowers vnto him.<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 8.</note> That ſome of them haue beene ſeene to record by themſelues in the night time, that, which they haue beene taught in the day time, to the ende that they might the better put it in practiſe. That marching in troupes, the eldeſt amongſt them goeth formoſt, as captaine: and another behinde them as ordering the rereward: that intending to paſſe any riuer, they put the yoongeſt elephants formoſt, knowing that the great elephants would ſinke lower, becauſe of their exceſſiue heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and would by that meanes make the fourd more difficult to paſſe, by reaſon of the water, which would gather there. That they doe no harme except they be prouoked thereto; and alſo that they are ſo gentle towards other weake beaſts, that paſſing by a flocke of ſmall cattell, they will gently turne backe with their heads all thoſe beaſts which they meete, for feare of hurting them, or treading them vnder their feete. They are verie long liued, euen to two hundred or three hundred yeeres, as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:8737:199"/>
affirmeth: and when the male and female couple together as man and woman, they withdraw themſelues for this purpoſe into moſt ſecret and hidden places: and the females bear their yoong ones for two yeeres together, and do neuer bring foorth but one, and that but once onely in their life. Of their teeth is the true iuorie made: but becauſe there are but few to be had, therefore ſome ſaw and cut in pieces the bones of Elephants, which they ſell for iuorie. Moreouer, Hiſtoriographers report that the firſt time that Elephants were ſeene at Rome, was in the triumph of <hi>Pompey,</hi> after he had ſubdued Africke, for he had two yoked to his chariot: and that in the turnies, and fence-playes which <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus Caeſar</hi> made, to ſhew paſtime to the people of Rome, there were Elephants that leaped, as if they would skippe and daunce: and that fortie two Elephants were brought in triumph to Rome after the memorable victorie, which <hi>Ruſcius Metellus</hi> did obtaine in Sicily againſt the Carthaginians.</p>

For they ſerue to ride vpon, to beare great burthens, and alſo to ſhew men paſtime in many exerciſes which is taught them by vſe. There are ſome in all parts of the world, but they abound in Africa. And the Arabians hold them for their greateſt riches and poſſeſſions. There are three kindes of them; one whereof is verie great, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſort are verie little: theſe two kindes hauing but one bunch vpon their backes: and the other are of meane ſtature, and haue two bunches, each whereof are fit to carrie burthens, and to ride vpon alſo: beſides, ſome of them reſemble aſſes in colour, and ſome are reddiſh: and they haue their hoofes almoſt clouen in two, but not exactly, ſo that their foote expreſſeth a kinde of ſemblance of fiue toes fleſhie vnderneath, which maketh them tender in ſtonie places. The beſt Camels are thoſe of Africa, becauſe they beare their charges for the ſpace of fortie daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without euer eating any oates, but onely ſuch graſſe as is in the fields, or ſome boughes: and their leaſt burthen is of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand waight: being by a naturall inſtinct ſo vrged to the ſeruice of man, that with the leaſt touch which may be vpon their necke or knees, they will preſently bend and kneele vpon the ground to receiue their loade; which when they feele to be anſwerable to their ſtrength, they riſe againe vpon their feete. There are ſome of them ſo ſwift, that they will run fiftie miles and more in
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:8737:199"/>
one day: but theſe are of ſmall ſtature, being good for nothing but to ride vpon. The noblemen of Arabia, Numidia, and Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans of Lybia do neuer vſe other ſteeds. And when the king of Tombuto would haue any matter of importance to be ſignified to the merchants of Numidia with ſpeed, he ſendeth a Poſte vpon one of his camels, who runneth from Tombuto to Darha, or Segelmeſſa in the ſpace of ſeuen or eight daies, which are about fower hundred and fiftie French miles: being a countrey full of deſerts, ſo that the way is verie hard to finde out, but by the verie direction of the Camell it ſelfe. When theſe beaſts are luſtie, which laſteth for fortie daies together with them, they waxe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fierce and outragious, and will remember the leaſt blow that their maſters ſhall ſtrike them with a ſticke: ſo that if they may faſten their teeth vpon any of them, they will lift them vp into the aire, then caſt them downe againe, and murther them with their fore-feete, in terrible and grieuous manner: but that time being paſſed, they become gentle and tractable, as before. They neuer drinke but from fiue daies to fiue daies, and ſometimes they ſtay nine, or fifteene daies; whether it be by cuſtome, or that this beaſt is drie, or elſe that Nature hath ſo well prouided that this creature which liueth in deſerts, ſhould haue no need to drinke oftentimes in thoſe places, where water is ſeldome found. He daunceth at the ſound of the trumpet, and ſeemeth to reioice at muſicke, refreſhing himſelfe, and taking new courage, then, when (being tyred with a tedious iourney) his guide beginneth to ſing ſome merrie ſong:<note place="margin">Lib. 9.</note> and ſome alſo haue beene ſeene to daunce at the ſound of a tabor, as the Author of the deſcription of Africa doth teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>Now ſpeake we of the Rhinoceros (which is named by ſome the Bull of India) being admirable amongſt other beaſts.<note place="margin">Of the Rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros.</note> For he is almoſt as big as the Elephant, his thighes are bigger, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of wood, being all naturally armed with ſhels, which he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth like bucklers. He hath in the vppermoſt part of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head an horne for the length of a ſpan or more, very hard, ſtrong, ſtraight, and verie ſharpe, which turneth towards the forehead, and when he will fight he whetteth it. And there are ſome alſo which haue another little horne vpon the skinne of their backe, which is ſo hard and difficult to penetrate, that no arrow how ſharpe ſoeuer it be, can pierce it thorough. And therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians arme themſelues with their skins, as we doe with harneis
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:8737:200"/>
and murrions, and couer their horſes with it, as we doe ours with barbs and armour. This beaſt hath continuall warre with the Elephant, and is his great enemie, fighting chiefly with him, yea and with all other beaſts, when the female bringeth foorth her yoong ones: of which the male is ſo carefull, that nothing dare come nigh him, but he will wreake his furie thereon. And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth for the moſt part victorious ouer the Elephant, if he can picke him vnder the belly, as being the ſofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">

                     </gap> place of all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. For when the Rhinoceros doth ſtrike him there, he giueth him ſo deepe a wound, that the Elephant can hardly ſcape death. And he hath this wit naturally, that when he will prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to fight, he whetteth his horne againſt ſome rocke: which horne the Indians vſe in many things, and eſpecially againſt all poyſon: ſo that being bitten or ſtung by any ſerpent, or other venemous beaſt, they haue their recourſe to this horne. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the author of the vniuerſall Coſmographie taketh occaſion to ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">Theu. lib. 11.</note> that that which is attributed to the Vnicorne, is the propertie of the Rhinoceros, and that the pieces which are ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnder the name of Vnicornes-horne, are of the horne of this Indie-beaſt: conſidering that there are as many ſuch Vnicornes as <hi>Plinie, Solinus,</hi> and <hi>Munster</hi> write of, as there be Phenixes or Griffrons.

Hee hath a long bodie of tawny colour, a fierce looke, his taile long, which he oftentimes mooueth, his haire before ſoft, and broad, his skin impenetrable: his hinder part narow, a great head, a wide throat, his necke and teeth ſo ſtrong, that hee can carry away a camell, and he is armed with very great and ſtrong clawes: beſides he is ſo hardie that hee feareth not alone to aſſaile two hundred men. And then are they in their chiefeſt ſtrength, when the haire of their neck is ſo long that it couereth their neck and ſhoulders. Africa nouriſheth many of theſe beaſts, being moſt cruell, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:8737:200"/>
in the kingdome of Fez, and in all Aethiopia: but they which keepe in the colde mountaines are not ſo dangerous, nor ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to men. For in a litle towne named (Pietra Roſſa) which is very neere to a forreſt that ſtretcheth out all along the foot of a mountaine of the ſaide countrey, Lions doe oftentimes enter, with ſo great mildenes, that they gather togither, and eate the bones and other things which they finde caſt about the ſtreetes: and the women and children are ſo accuſtomed thereto, that they are in no wiſe afraid of them. So many Hiſtoriographers doe write, that the Lion onely amongſt wilde beaſts, will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thoſe that couch and humble themſelues before him. And how furious ſoeuer he be, yet will he rather runne vpon a man then at a woman; and will neuer ſet vpon children, except he be very much oppreſſed by hunger. He knoweth when the Lioneſſe, who by nature is very laſciuious and wanton, doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her-ſelfe to be couered by the Leopard: and then doth hee runne furiouſly vpon her to chaſtice her: which cauſeth the Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to haue the craft to go waſh herſelfe in ſome riuer, to take away the ſent of the Leopard, who hath beene with her: or elſe ſhe will follow the Lion a farre off, to the end that he may not ſmell her. This beaſt drinketh little, and eateth but in one day of twaine: and if he be well ſufficed, he will remaine three daies after without eating. When he findeth himſelfe aſſailed with ſhot, he declareth his greatnes of courage, in that he maketh no account thereof, endeuoring to defend himſelfe by the onelie hideouſnes of his countenance: and it ſeemeth verily that hee proteſteth to be conſtrained to annoy thoſe who purſue him, in defence of himſelfe: in ſuch ſort, that rather through rage then for feare of death, he ſets him in his owne guard. And he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrateth alſo another generoſitie of hart, in that that feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ouermatched both by dogs and hunters, if it be in an open fielde where he may be ſeene, he will make ſemblant to deſpiſe and ſcorne the hounds, ſometimes making head againſt them, and will retire by little and little for his honour, alwaies ſtanding vpon his guard: but after that he hath gotten the woode, where he may not be ſeene to flie, he runs away as faſt as he can, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well that the place couereth his ſhame. If he feele him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtroken and wounded, he can marke him who gaue him the blowe, and will euer turne vpon him, how great a number ſoeuer there be of people: and yet for all his fury he quaketh to heare
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:8737:201"/>
the rumbling of wagons, and is afraid to ſee a cocke which ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp himſelfe and clappeth his wings, and more afraid when he croweth: but aboue all he feareth fire. They ſay alſo that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be neuer ſicke but through pride: and that they which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them, being minded to chaſe them, yea to madde them, do tie apes neere vnto them, whoſe trickes and geſtures they take in ſcorne; and vexe themſelues much thereat. But it is ſtrange that theſe furious and proud beaſts, are tamed by the induſtrie of man, euen to make them ſo familiar as to ſerue them. For hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries report, that <hi>Marcus Anthonius</hi> during the ciuill warres of the Romanes; cauſed Lions to be coupled to endure the yoke, and draw his chariot; and that hee entred Rome in triumph in ſuch equipage. That <hi>Hanno</hi> alſo, captaine of the Carthaginians, did firſt vndertake to touch Lions with his hand, and that hee made them go vp and downe the towne like little dogs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the people doubting ſo quicke and pearcing a wit, which could inuent how to tame the fierceſt beaſt of all others, tooke occaſion to ſuppoſe their common welth but badly aſſured in his hands,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de. ſingul. c. 76.</note> and ſo they baniſhed him. <hi>Belon</hi> alſo in his obſeruations recounteth, that there is an ancient church at Conſtantinople, to euery piller whereof there is a Lion tied, which the great Turke cauſeth to be nouriſhed, and that their gouernors looſe them, handle them, and tie them againe when they liſt, ſometimes lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them through the citie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Tigre.</note>The Tiger approcheth neere to the force of the Lion, and is more to be feared, becauſe of his crueltie and ſwiftnes, which they finde true who chaſe after their yoong ones. For when they carie them away, running with all ſpeede vpon good horſes, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe returneth to her denne, and finding it emptie, taketh her courſe as ſwift as the winde, following them by the tract, which haue robbed her of her yoong ones: who perceiuing her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch by the noiſe that ſhe maketh, vſe to caſt her downe one, which ſhe taketh in her mouth, and carieth to her denne with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ſpeed, how heauie ſoeuer it be: and afterwards retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the purſuite of the reſt, alwaies purſuing her fawnes, till ſuch time as ſhe beholdeth that ſhe cannot come at thoſe who beare them away, becauſe they haue gained ſome towne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are immured. Theſe beaſts are very common in Hircania, as alſo in the Indies, and in Aethiopia: and the inhabitants there do hunt them much, becauſe it is a very dangerous beaſt, which
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:8737:201"/>
would do much harme if it might multiplie: as alſo becauſe their skinne is very faire, whereof they make very excellent furres, which haue ſpots of diuers colours, wherewith they cloth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But howſoeuer cruell the Tigre is, yet the Hircanians do nouriſh and tame them for their pleaſure. And <hi>Plinie</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 8. c. 4.</note> that the Tigreſſe hath ſuch feare and reſpect of man, that ſo ſoone as ſhe perceiueth him out of her denne, ſhe preſently conueieth her yoong ones thence: whereupon this author doth take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to admire the power of nature, in that the greateſt and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt of all beaſts do preſently vnderſtand wherefore to feare, without euer hauing ſeene any thing before, which might cauſe feare. He recounteth alſo, that the emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was the firſt that euer ſhewed the people of Rome a tame Tigreſſe in a cage, and that after him <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi> ſhewed fowre at a time.<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Panther is another common beaſt in the regions of of Africa, very ſauage, and whom the inhabitants dread much.<note place="margin">Of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Some ſay that the Lucernes and Leopards are one kind of beaſts, and that they ſerue for males to the Panther, not differing from them but in whitenes, which is very great in her, hauing little blacke ſpots ſet vpon her body, in manner of eies. Alſo very faire furres are made of her skinne, which are called Lucernes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer ſome ſay that all fower-footed beaſts do very much loue the ſmell of the Panther: but the fiercenes of her countenance doth feare them: and that to entrap other by her odour, ſhe hides her head that ſhe may catch them. Some alſo write that ſhe hath a marke vpon her ſhoulder like to an halfe moone, which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth and decreaſeth as the moone doth. This kinde of beaſts haue the craft to watch paſſengers in woods, hiding themſelues cloſe in the thickeſt groues of trees which they can finde; out of which they ſtart vpon them like theeues. And they haue this by nature, to fold in their clawes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they go, that they may alwaies keepe them ſharpe &amp; vnbroken: and can open them when they wil, &amp; ſhut them when they graſpe any thing. But omitting the fiercenes of this beaſt, who will not greatly admire the ſenſe and imagination of a certaine Panther whereof <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth?<note place="margin">Lib. 8. c. 17.</note> She deſiring to meete with ſome paſſenger, lurked cloſe in the midſt of an high way: One by chance comming thither, &amp; finding hir, would for feare haue turned his bridle to flee. But the poore beaſt couched and fell downe before him, making ſignes to fawne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and moaned, and tormented hirſelfe in ſuch ſort, as hee
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:8737:202"/>
might eaſily vnderſtand thereby that ſhee was in great paine: and indeede hir young ones were fallen into a pit farre off from that place. The man taking hart, at the beaſts manners, who drew him gently by the garment, did follow hir to the ſame pit: whither beeing come, and knowing the occaſion of the panthers greefe, he drew hir yong ones out of the place whereinto they were fallen, deliuering by this meanes, their damme of paine, and redeeming alſo his owne life. For this beaſt, which could haue bereft him of it, did contrariwiſe in acknowledgement of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite receiued by him, leaping, and skipping with hir little ones, keepe the man companie out of the forreſt, ſhewing him by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſignes, that ſhee rendred thankes vnto him.

                  <p>AMongſt all ſauage beaſts, there are none more common then the Woolfe. For Aſia, Africa, Europe, and many places of that fourth part of the world, which late Coſmographers and other famous men haue by their long nauigations diſcouered, do nouriſh theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And although many haue thought that England had none of them, yet there are ſome found in ſundry places, and eſpecially about Barwick. And in times paſt the country hath beene much vexed by them. But hiſtories record, that <hi>Edgar</hi> their king, who liued in the time of <hi>Lotharius</hi> king of France, a very politicke prince, beeing aduertiſed of the ſpoile which theſe beaſts did, made an edict throughout his land, that euery Nobleman ſhould bring vnto him each yeere tenne woolues, or elſe the skinnes of them; and that the prince of Wales, as he who receiued greateſt commodity by hunting of them, ſhould euery yeere bring him an hundred. Whereby it came to paſſe that in leſſe then tenne yeeres, there was no mention made of any of thoſe beaſts. Now though they bee very common, yet are they therefore worthie of no leſſe conſideration,<note place="margin">Of the Wolfe.</note> and woonder. Many authors haue written concerning their ſhape, manners, nature, and differences, as alſo how to hunt and take them. There bee few which are ignorant, that the woolfe is a beaſt hauing gray haire, mixed with black,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:8737:202"/>
whitiſh vnder the bellie, a big head armed with long and ſtrong teeth: and ſhort, and ſtiffe eares, whereupon the prouerbe aroſe (I hold the woolfe by the eares) when he which ſpeaketh is in doubt of what hee ſhall doe. This beaſt feedes onely vpon fleſh, ſaue ſometimes on fiſh, although <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> write,<note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. 8. ch. 5. de. hiſt. anima.</note> that beeing oppreſſed with hunger hee eateth earth. But indeede this opinion did firſt ſpring, becauſe that theſe beaſts are oftentimes ſeene to dig vp the fieldes for fleſh, which they bury after they haue had their fill, to ſerue them when they want ought to pray vpon. When they be ſick, they know how to vſe certaine herbes, to make them vomit, and to looſen their belly: And their cuſtome is to aſſaile weake and fearefull perſons that trauaile alone, much rather then hunters. They are ſo knowne to the fiſher men along the lake of Meotis (as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth) that theſe honeſt people are wont to giue them part of their fiſh: which if they faile to doe,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 10. c. 8.</note> they will in the night time teare and breake their nets. When the ſhe woolfe hath yong ones, if ſhe find hir ſelfe oppreſſed with dogs, or men, ſhe taketh one of hir whelpes in hir mouth to beare away, that ſhee may not looſe them all. And ſhee neuer leaues them except the hee woolfe remaine for their gard, going both by turnes out for victuals: and if they haue taken any beaſt, they bring it vnto their whelps, laying it downe before them to feede vpon: If they be ſomewhat big, they will then bring home ſome lamb aliue, to make them kill it, and teach them their craft. But I finde nothing more admirable in the nature of the woolfe then that which hath beene noted by the author of the country farme,<note place="margin">Auth. de la Maiſon ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</note> that there breede and engender certaine ſerpents in the kidneies of an old woolfe: which being growne doe at laſt worke their breeders death, and become very venemous things. Concerning the ſubtlety and craft of woolues to intrap their praies, it is very well knowen by euerie one, being to the great hurt of people; but their induſtrie is verie great in forreſts, where they can tell how to hunt the Hart &amp; does, watching them in freſh places, as hounds ſhould do, yea they can direct themſelues, like a courſe of greyhounds to watch &amp; lurke in the borders of the wood, whileſt others hunt within. Beſides, it is a common thing, and many haue written therof; yea <hi>Iſidore</hi> himſelfe, that if a woolfe eſpy a man be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the man perceiue him, he can take away his voice; becauſe that with his corrupt breath he infecteth the aire: which being ſo putrified doth alſo corrupt the breath of the man, neer to the ſaid
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:8737:203"/>
beaſt, whereby he remaineth depriued of voice, and hoarſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he be endomaged thereby: and that is it which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the common prouerbe <hi>(Lupus eſt in fabula)</hi> which is ſaid, when one ſpeaking of another, that comes in vnlooked for, doth hold his peace, as if that the other parties arriual had taken away his voice and ſpeech. But if the woolfe be firſt ſeene by a man, it is thought that this malitious effect is not of ſo great power, and that he looſeth much of his fiercenes: the cauſe whereof may be that knowing himſelfe diſcouered, he hath not the leiſure to ſpread abroad his venim, and inſteed of running vpon the man, he deuiſeth how hee may runne and flye from him. If this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be of any value, I doe not thinke that it hath beene yet writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by any one, at leaſtwiſe as I haue read or heard. There is alſo another kinde of Wolues,<note place="margin">Of the Lynx.</note> called Lynx, the furre of whom Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces weare, which (as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith) reſemble other wolues, but that they are ſpotted like Leopards. And <hi>Oppianus</hi> writeth that they are engendred by a Woolfe and a Panther: yet that cannot be affirmed of the Lynx of Germanie, for there are no Panthers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Beare.</note>The Beare is a beaſt, in whom many things are found woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be noted. Barbarie and Newfound land nouriſh a great number, whom the inhabitants do hunt after diuers manners. But they doe chiefly entrap them by meanes of certaine deepe pits, couered ouer with leaues and branches, which they digge in the way that theſe beaſts are accuſtomed to frequent, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially neere vnto trees, where there is ſome ſwarme of Bees: for the Beare loueth honie aboue all other meate, whether it be for that he delightes to glut himſelfe therewith, or elſe to heale the ſorenes of eies whereto he is very ſubiect: and ſo paſſing vpon theſe pits, he falleth thereinto, and is there ſlaine by theſe Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. The male when he couereth the female, doth embrace her, as man doth woman; and the ſhe Beare being full doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire apart into her den, not bearing aboue thirtie daies, and doth oftentimes bring foorth fiue Beare-whelpes: which at firſt doe ſeeme to be but an heape of white fleſh, without any forme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eies, without haire, and is as ſmall as a mouſe, with ſome little apparance of nailes, but through very much licking the ſhe Beare reduceth them into ſuch forme as they haue. When this beaſt is vnprouided of a caue, he buildeth his lodging with wood; of which he makes ſo huge an heape, and piles it ſo well, that the raine cannot enter thereinto. After that he paues it, and makes
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:8737:203"/>
his litter with the ſofteſt leaues of trees that he can finde. In win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time the male keepeth within his den for fortie daies long, and neuer bougeth, and the female for fowre moneths: and the firſt fourteene daies they ſleepe ſo profoundly, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to wake them, though they be beaten with ſtaues: and one would not thinke how fatte they then be: this time being paſt, they ſit vpon their taile and liue of nothing elſe, but by ſucking their forefeete. Being come foorth of their denne, they firſt eate of the herbe called Wake-Robbin, or Cuckow-pintle, to open their pipes, which are all as it were ſtopped vp. Their foode is corne, leaues of trees, grapes, apples, honie, creuiſes, and ants: which they vſe eſpecially licking them vp with their toongs from off the ground, when they are ſicke with eating the fruite of Mandrakes: for by this meanes they heale themſelues. They go vpright vpon their hinder feete when they liſt, &amp; deſcend downe trees backwards. And when they fight againſt the bull, or other horned beaſt, they hang themſelues by all their fowre feete vpon them, and vpon their head, that they may thereby tire their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and ſo vanquiſh him. To conclude, there is no creature more ſubtile in his ſimplicitie.</p>
                  <p>But if we would ſpeake of craftie beaſts,<note place="margin">Of the Ape.</note> ſubtile in all agilitie and ſport, then muſt we haue reſpect to the Ape. For nature hath beſtowed very good ſenſe and meruailous craft vpon him. Alſo he doth verie neere approch to the ſhape of man, both in his forme of countenance, noſe, eies, and eie-lids: the vnder part of which there is no beaſt that hath except the Ape. He hath alſo nipples vpon his breſt like a man, and vſeth his hands and legs as man; hauing nailes and fingers made and diſpoſed as ours, of which the middle moſt is longeſt. His intrailes likewiſe are almoſt like to thoſe of man. Africa and many Iſles of the New-found lands nouriſh theſe creatures in great plenty, and of diuers kinds; ſome whereof are called Monckeies, and they haue long tailes; and others are Iackes or Marmuſets, and they haue none: they liue of herbes, and corne: and when they meane to ſteale ſome cares of corne, there aſſemble twenty or thirtie of them togither, and one ſtaies for a ſcout out of the fielde, where he no ſooner eſpieth the Lord of the ground to come, but he ſqueakes verie loud, at whoſe crie all the reſt runne away, and do ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by nimble flight, climing vp trees, and skipping from one to another, yea and the ſhe apes, with their yoong ones vpon
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:8737:204"/>
their ſhoulders, will leape from tree to tree like the reſt. And they are commonly ſo fond of their yoong ones, that with too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten embracing, and too much claſping them, they at laſt kill them. They which are tamed and taught, do meruailous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible things. Beſides the author of the vniuerſall Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie hath noted,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 16.</note> that in the ſolitarie Iſland there are Apes, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vnhappier, and wilder then are in all the world elſe, which be named Magots: who being ſeene a farre off, a man would iudge them to be humaine people. Whereupon he thinketh that ſome are a little deceiued, who haue written concerning Sauages, and men being rough all ouer their bodies like goats, liuing vpon ſnailes and rawe fleſh, hauing perhaps taken ſuch Magots, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not beene neere to diſtinguiſh them) for verie men. But enough of this, I would now haue you (ARAM) to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the ſubiect of our diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>I Will now ſpeake of the moſt gentle and ſimple beaſt of all the world,<note place="margin">Of the Hart.</note> in his nature, and which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe is endued with great force, which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vſeth to the coſt of thoſe who hunt him: and that is the Hart or Stag, in whoſe chaſe great Lords take much pleaſure. He is ſo ſimple that he muſeth, &amp; is aſtoniſhed at euerie thing: in ſuch ſort, as if he ſee a cowe or an horſe come neere vnto him, he neuer taketh regard who rides him; or if he perceiue him, hee lookes downe at his feet, as if he were amaſed, what bowe &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, or weapons ſoeuer he haue. He muſeth alſo at the ſongs and piping of ſhepheards. When ſtagges be not in rut, they are verie ſharpe at their victuals: and feeling themſelues fat, they ſearch out ſolitarie places apart, and there abide, knowing verie wel, that they are not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apt for the courſe, &amp; that they are then alſo chiefly hunted. Being purſued, they doe ofttimes ſtay their flight to take breath, and looke here &amp; there round about them; but when they perceiue the hounds that follow them, they runne as before. And they make theſe ſtops, by reaſon of a certaine pipe, which doth greatly paine them, and which is ſo tender, that it preſently breaketh with the leaſt wound that may be. They
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:8737:204"/>
endeuour to runne with the winde, that it may carrie with them the ſent away from the hounds, ſo that they may not eaſily take them. They heare a farre off, and haue a verie good eare, when they ſtand vpon their feete: but if they lye downe they be verie deafe. <hi>Plinie</hi> recounteth,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 8. c. 32.</note> that when the harts or ſtags of Cilicia will paſſe from thence into Cyprus, they ſwimme ouer the ſea, but alwaies in troupes, and in order, reſting the heads of the one vpon the crupper of the other, and that by turnes, in ſuch ſort, that the hindermoſt goe before in their turne, and the foremoſt turne behinde: directing their courſe by the ſmell of the lande, becauſe they cannot ſee the ſhore. The bucks onely are armed with hornes, and they alone of all beaſts caſt their hornes euerie ſpringtime: yet ſome haue ſeene (but verie ſeldome) horned-does marked to twelue yeers. When they feele that their hornes will fall, they ſeeke out the moſt ſolitarie and deſert places that they can finde, whether it bee to hide them becauſe they are aſhamed to haue loſt their armes, or elſe to diſappoint men of the benefit that doth redound vnto them thereby, for their horne hath many properties in vſe. And many ſay that of thoſe hornes which harts caſt: the right are neuer found againe, ſo that it is holden for certaine, that they bury their right horne. Their age is knowne by their heads, becauſe that euerie yeere they haue a knag more, and there are ſome ſeene that are marked to two and twentie: Beyond which, none doth note their age, although they liue much longer. For Hiſtories record that aboue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, there was an Hart taken, about whoſe necke this Prince whileſt hee liued had put a coller of gold, and that he was growne ſo great after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſo fat, that the ſaid coller was hid within his fleſh, and couered with his skinne. Moreouer, ſtags doe change their place of aboade, and their food according as the ſunne doth approch in height. For in the moneth of Nouember, they keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to buſhes and briers, the tops whereof they eate to reſtore their nature after they haue beene in rut. In December they withdraw themſelues into the thickeſt of forreſts, which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from the cold windes, ſnowes and yee. In Ianuarie they come to the borders of the forreſts, and to tilled landes, to feede on greene corne, as rie, and ſuch like. In Februarie and March, becauſe they looſe and caſt their hornes, they thruſt themſelues amongſt the buſhes, wherein they remaine all Aprill
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:8737:205"/>
and May. In Iune and Iuly they goe into woods and corne-fields, and then are they fatteſt. And in September and October they leaue their woods, and fall to rut: and then haue they neither any certaine place, nor meat, becauſe they follow the waies which the does haue paſſed: liuing then with a little, and feeding vpon what they chaunce to meete with.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the Bore.</note>The Bore is another beaſt, in whoſe chaſe many exerciſe themſelues, and take ſingular pleaſure: but as the Hart is gentle and fearfull; ſo is the Bore hardie and furious, not fearing the dogs, but attendeth for them in quiet, and oftentimes alſo hee purſueth them, to teare them in pieces with his teeth; the biting whereof, chiefly in the cheſt of the bodie is almoſt incurable. His place of aboad is neuer certaine; &amp; therfore ſome ſay he is but a gueſt, bicauſe he doth but run out of one forreſt &amp; wood into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: and yet he delighteth to remaine in the ſame countrey and place wherein he was firſt farrowed: ſo that if any dogs chaſe him out of any wood or forreſt, he preſently runs without any ſtay to his natiue place, which he ſuppoſeth to be his ſafeguard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. The meate which he liketh beſt, is haſell-nuts, beech-maſt, and acornes. His fleſh is better then harts-fleſh: And therefore the auncient Romanes made ſuch account thereof, that in their moſt magnificent bankets, they would ſerue in whole Bores to be ſet vpon the table.<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 11. c. 53.</note> Yet <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, that the Bores of the mountaines in Pamphilia and Cilicia, hauing eaten Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, become verie venemous; in ſuch ſort as they poyſon thoſe that eate of their fleſh. Beſides, when theſe beaſts feele them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more heauie then of cuſtome, they ſeeke for iuie, and eate thereof: or elſe for crabs, which they finde in ſande when the ſea ebs. The ſow or female beareth but once a yeere, although the Bore be verie apt to couer her. And the Author of the aforeſaide naturall hiſtorie doth affirme vnto vs, that in the Indies there are verie great wilde bores, which haue two tuskes in their mouth of a cubit long, and two other that iſſue out of their front like the hornes of a cow. And <hi>Cardanus</hi> ſaith, that in the ſame countrey there are bores like to others in forme, in voice and maners, and in their litteridge, which are growne in two moneths, and yet are ſmaller then conies, and can ſcarce bite: differing nothing from other, ſaue that they haue fiue or ſixe toes vpon their feete in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of nailes.</p>

Let vs but onely note the meate which Turkie-cockes, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon foules, whom we ſo carefully bring vp for vs to feede vpon, do moſt ſeeke after. Certainely, there is no beaſt which eateth more vncleanely and filthie meate, for they ſpare neither ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents nor toads: and yet we eſteeme of their fleſh, egs and chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, as of verie good and delicate meat. This is in truth a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous kinde of naturall chimiſtrie and inimitable art,<note place="margin">Excellent chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtrie in the nature of beaſts.</note> ſo to ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that which of it ſelfe is poiſon, and would prooue ſo to man, that hauing paſſed through the limbeck and fire of a ſmall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is not onely purged thereby from al annoyance; but doth alſo ſuſtaine life, and ſerue afterwards for holeſome nouriture to man. And do we not behold, that the nightingall and the wood-ſparrow (are fat with eating venemous ſpiders) which ſerue both for meat and a medicine to them? <hi>Plinie</hi> hath written,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:8737:210"/>
that deere and quailes do feede vpon poyſon,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 10. c. 72. Lib. 11. c. 53.</note> and yet euerie one knoweth that their fleſh is a delicious kinde of meate. But what another woonder is this which the ſame author declareth, that there be certaine beaſts which are not venemous of themſelues, and yet are dangerous meat, when they haue eaten any vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſt or herbe? For in the mountaines of Pamphilia and of Cilicia, the bores that haue eaten Salamanders, are verie vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; in ſuch ſort as they poyſon thoſe who eate of their fleſh: and yet they themſelues can conuert ſuch poyſon to their owne nouriſhment. What reaſon can we giue of ſo excellent a ſecret in the nature of beaſts? I haue neuer yet learned any reaſon of the Philoſophers. Let vs then ſtay at the admirable effects of the prouidence of God, who in thoſe beaſts, which we doe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eate for our ſuſtenance, doth performe this maruellous chimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie whereof wee but now ſpake, and who cauſeth the force of poyſons to be ſpent in the deſerts, to the ſmall hurt of man, to the end that his omnipotencie, bountie and benignitie may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in all things towards vs.</p>

For it is verie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that God maketh all this ſerue to the profit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of men: in ſo much as there is a kinde of amitie commonly in priuate and tame beaſts, towards ſuch as they are, all ſeruing him who hath bin eſtabliſhed for their maſter: and that enimitie doth rather remaine amongſt wilde beaſts, as alſo in tame beaſts towards the wilde: In ſuch ſort as many ſauage beaſts, which doe nothing but harme, haue by this meanes many of their owne kinde their aduerſaries to make head againſt them, and to reſiſt them in whatſoeuer they would doe. But wee may eſpecially woonder in that the moſt mightie, great and ſtrong beaſts, yea the moſt furious and cruell are commonly put in feare, by the ſmalleſt and moſt weake.

Alſo there are verie little beaſts, who doe not onely put verie great and cruell

For we are ſerued with their labours, and trauaile, with their fruit, with their fleſh, with their wool, and with their skinnes. For from whence receiue wee our clothing, except linnen, but from beaſts? With how many ſorts of wooles and of skins do they furniſh vs?<note place="margin">Of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that men haue by tame beaſts.</note> And from whence haue wee the ſilkes, cloth, and workes which are made and which ſerue to cloath the moſt ſtout and proud tyrants, and other princes of the earth? Haue wee them not by the induſtry of wormes, and ſmall vermine? In very truth, wee may very well ſay, that wormes cloath wormes, and that the moſt ſtately amongſt men doe take from the moſt vile amongſt creatures the ſubſtance of their bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie and pomp. For what are men, but poore wormes of the earth, who to make themſelues a little excell the reſt, do take
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:8737:211"/>
from other wormes the ornaments of their magnificence? And if we conſider what commodity the milke which is drawne from ſome beaſts doth deliuer vnto a thouſand thouſand perſons, if we conſider of the great multitude that there is of all kinds of foure-footed beaſts, of birdes and of fiſhes; all which doe ſerue vs for foode and nouriſhment in diuers manners: if how many ſundry taſtes and ſauours we finde in all theſe meates of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to the taſts, complexions and diſpoſitions of men, and which are ſo tempered, that they bee good for thoſe that are in health, for thoſe that are ſick, for great, for ſmall, for yoong, for olde: ſhall we not be rauiſhed with all theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, thereby to giue glorie to the ſoueraigne Creator and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of all nature? What ſhall we more ſay in that the skins of earthly beaſts, are of ſo many diuers colours, and ſo well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, either of woole, or of haire, or of good skins, of the varietie and diuerſitie that there is in the feathers of birds, and in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of them, and in their ſongs, which miniſter much pleaſure to melancholy perſons: are not theſe ſo many excellent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the power of the Omnipotent, who created all theſe things through his bountie and benignitie towards vs? Surely there is nothing ſo vile &amp; contemptible in the leaſt creature that is, but doth preach the Maieſtie of God vnto vs. And therefore he ſaid vnto his ſeruant <hi>Iob,</hi>

                  <p>I ſpeake not here of the nature of beaſts, nor of the induſtrie which God hath giuen to euerie one of them, to know what is conuenient or hurtfull for them, and to couet the one, and auoid the other: as alſo how they are furniſhed with care and power, to preſerue their life, and the liues of their yoong ones.

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:8737:212"/>
But I will here bring into the number one of the leaſt and moſt common ſort, which wee behold euerie day in our houſes: for perhaps the conſideration thereof will not be altogither vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto vs;<note place="margin">Many things to bee conſidered of in the nature of the Cock.</note> and that is the cocke. If any queſtion be made concerning his beautie, in what birde may we finde more, be it, that we conſider of his plumage, and the diuerſitie of colours, which is commonly therin, or of his faire kingly creſt, or his ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pace and braue carriage, which cannot be more magnificent in the greateſt monarch of the world? And if this birde were not ſo common, but were verie ſeldome ſeene, there are but few other creatures which would be preferred before him, although there were nothing woorthie of conſideration in his nature, ſaue that which we haue alreadie declared. What ſhall we ſay then, if we will but meditate, of what hart and courage he is in fight? Is there any other creature which can leſſe endure to be ouercome, and is more aſhamed thereof? Againe, what curteſie vſeth he amongſt the hens, with whom he is conuerſant? and how much doth hee loue them, euen to prouide for meat to feed them, and to take it out of his owne beake, to giue vnto them, calling them when he hath found it, as the henne calleth her little chickens together? But that which I finde moſt ſtrange in him, is the agreement which by nature he hath with the Sunne, which is ſuch, as one may verie well thinke, that he hath ſome naturall Aſtronomie and Aſtrologie, which is bred in him. For he vnderſtandeth and perceiueth the courſe and motion of the heauen and of the Sun, and when his riſing doth approch, ſo that he declareth it by his crowing, verie timely in the morning, and that diuers times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other creature can perceiue it; yea or men themſelues, except they riſe out of their beds to behold the skie. And yet for all that they muſt haue obtained ſome knowledge of the courſe and of the motion of heauen; either by the ſcience of Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, or through long vſe and continuall obſeruations thereof, as is with ſhepherds, and thoſe that watch in the fields. But if the heauens be couered with cloudes, what can the moſt expert of them know therein, ſaue by meanes of clocks, which they haue in their houſes? The cocke then is more skilfull in this art. For without euer mouing from the place where he is at rouſt to ſleep, and what weather ſoeuer there be, faire or fowle; yet doth not he faile to ſound out the chimes at his howers, ſo, as there is no clock ſo certaine: and he ſerueth alſo for one to them that haue no
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:8737:212"/>
other. And therefore we may verie well ſay, that how many cocks there are in the world, ſo many naturall and domeſticall clockes are they for thoſe who haue them in their houſes. And doe we not ſee how that ſouldiers, eſpecially Almaines doe commonly carrie theſe creatures with them, to ſerue as a trumpet to them to ſound out the approch of day.<note place="margin">

And the like ought we to doe, ſo often as this birde croweth in the morning, not onely to thinke our ſelues aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the approch of the Sunne, which bringeth vs the temporall day, after the darknes of the night, but we muſt euerie day wake out of the ſleepe of ſinne, wherein we are ſo ſoundly laide; and prepare and diſpoſe our ſelues to receiue Ieſus Chriſt, the true Sunne of Iuſtice, which bringeth vs the eternall and perpetuall day, that is neuer changed into night; &amp; the light which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be obſcured by darknes.

Wherein, if we haue any woorthie matter deliuered vnto vs to acknowledge the prouidence, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and benignitie of God towards men, it is principally in this point which is notorious vnto all, that the vertue of this bleſſing hath beene ſuch, that thoſe beaſts, from whom we might receiue moſt commoditie, and which are moſt tame and familiar, haue much more multiplied, then the other wilde and cruell beaſts, who might bring any perill or endomagement vnto vs. Whereto God himſelfe had in ſome ſort, a regard when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Noah</hi> to enter into the arke,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> &amp; to take of cleane beaſts, ſeuen and ſeuen, male and female: but of vncleane beaſts, two and two onely. So that by this meane, there did moſt remaine of the number of thoſe, the vſe of whom was moſt neceſſarie for man: giuing vs alſo a certaine teſtimonie of his fatherly bountie towards vs, by which he is induced to haue reſpect vnto vs in all things.</p>
                  <p>But if we conſider what fecunditie there is in certaine ſauage beaſts, and yet how it vaniſheth, and is ſurmounted by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the other ſort (wherewith we ſerue our ſelues) by a certaine kinde of manner, which is altogether incomprehenſible vnto vs: there is no perſon, but will finde himſelfe rauiſhed in the contemplation thereof. For let vs take for inſtance the wolues only. It is certaine, that they are more fertile then ſheepe, kine, &amp; other priuate &amp; domeſtical beaſts, which ſerue for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our life, &amp; to other vſes for the commodity of the ſame.

one more in his kinde, then woolues and other cruell beaſts, who eat and deuour them. Are not theſe then admirable effects of the prouidence of God, the reaſon whereof doth ſurpaſſe the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our vnderſtanding? In very truth theſe things are no leſſe woonderfull (although there be great diuerſitie of the ſubiect) then the multiplication of the people of Iſraell amongſt the Egyptians, which was by ſo much the greater, by how much the more they were oppreſſed by tyrannie and cruell dealing.</p>
                  <p>Let vs alſo note,<note place="margin">Other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to the ſame purpoſe.</note> how that this eternall wiſedome fauouring the fertilitie of thoſe beaſts, that are moſt profitable for man, hath aſſigned to ſuch as liue vpon praie and rapine, an habitation in deſart and obſcure places, in rockes, caues, and in dens. For ſo it pleaſed God to ſeparate them from the other, to the ende that they might the leſſe annoy them. Moreouer he ſundered them amongſt themſelues: in ſuch ſort that they do not liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in companies, as others do, that they might not ouerrun them. For woolues, beares, lions, and ſuch like do not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate one with the other, as priuate and domeſticall beaſts doe: bicauſe they cannot agree one with another, as the peaceable and innocent beaſts. So likewiſe eagles, haukes, faulcons, and other birdes of praie, do not flie togither in volees and troupes, as pigeons, cranes, geeſe, &amp; ſuch like do, which ſerue vs for foode. Thereupon then enſueth, that wilde beaſts cannot gather ſo much power, as to hurt the other, vpon whom they make conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall warre: and who by this meane are oftentimes ſaued from perill. Let vs adde in regard of birds, that they of pray are not ſo fruitefull as thoſe which are giuen vnto vs for foode: Witneſſe the great number of chickens which the henne doth hatch at one time, and the number of the yoong ones of patridges &amp; quailes, in compariſon of thoſe who flie to deuour them. And although doues doe bring foorth but one at a time, yet they recompence that, inſomuch as they breed almoſt euery moneth in the yeere. In meditation then vpon theſe things, we muſt conſider what, and how great the bountie of God is towards vs: and that all his creatures muſt be as ſo many preachers ſtill to anounce vnto vs the puiſſance and infinite wiſedome of him; and as mirrors wherein he preſenteth himſelfe euery where before our eies. And when we ſerue him not according to our dutie, we are well woorthie to be ſet to ſchoole to ſuch maſters, as being beaſts, more brute, more wilde, more ſauage, then they who liue
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:8737:214"/>
with vs, and are created for to ſerue vs. It is then as <hi>Iſay</hi> ſaide to the Iſraelites who were ingratefull and rebellious againſt their God: [The oxe knoweth his owner, and the aſſe his maſters crib: but Iſraell hath not knowne, my people hath not vnderſtoode.] And indeed in theſe two kindes of creatures we haue a goodly example to raiſe vs out of our ſloth and ingratitude towards God: if we do but conſider onely, what benefits do redound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by the ſeruice which we haue of oxen in tilling of our lands, and drawing of carts and wagons: and by aſſes in bearing all loades and burdens which are laide vpon their backs. Wherein we are alſo to eſteeme of the prouidence of God, in regard of the forme of the bodies, and members of theſe beaſts. For he hath ſo diſpoſed them, that their onely figure and compoſition doth admoniſh men of the workes wherein theſe creatures muſt be imployed, &amp; of the vſes, whereto they muſt be put. For oxen do cleerely ſhew vs, that their back is not fit to beare packs nor ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but that their necke is fitte for the yoke, and their ſhoulders to draw carts and wagons: whereby one may eaſily iudge as alſo by their heauines, that they are vnfit to beare burdens like the aſſe, whoſe backe, head and ſhoulders, are apt for the ſame.</p>

within the earth, that they cannot be particularly deſcribed: and ſith that nature adorneth the earth with aboue fiue hundred kindes of plants, and with as many beaſts, it is verie likely, that ſhe exerciſeth no fewer meanes vnder earth, whereby to enrich it.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What mettall is, and of the kindes thereof.</note>Mettall is that which is pliable by the hammer, and hard: ſtones are hard, but not pliable; and wax and mud are pliable, but not hard. Mettalles are ſeuen in number, as the planets are. For gold repreſenteth the Sun; ſiluer, the Moone: amber called electrum, Mercurie: iron, Mars: lead, Saturne: braſſe, Venus: and copper, Iupiter: or elſe wee diſtinguiſh them in this ſort. All met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall is perfect, ſoft, and pure as gold: or, it is pure and hard, as ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: or, it is hard and impure, as iron: or, it is ſoft and impure, as lead. And for amber it is compounded of gold, and ſiluer; as cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus copper is made of braſſe, and iron: containing an equall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of braſſe, and of iron: which cauſeth that iron too much concocted and high tincted is eaſily changed into braſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed againe into copper. But wee will now ſpeake of gold, which is the moſt perfect and pureſt of all mettalles. In very truth nature neuer tooke delight to make a more perfect elementary ſubſtance then gold is: for it is as pure, and neate in the qualitie thereof, as are the ſimple elements whereof it is compoſed. And therefore by good right do wee hold it in price of excellencie far aboue all other riches, and do eſteeme it in our iudgement to bee much more precious then all other mettalles. For beeing in the compoſition thereof proportioned in equall qualitie, fitly correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent in the ſymmetry of the elements which compound it, it is euen from the originall thereof ſo purified already, as are the ſimple elements: In ſuch ſort, that by their coniunction togither in equall power, there is engendred ſo delicate, and perfect a mixture of indiſſoluble vnion, compoſing an accord ſo faithfully, that there is made thereby an incorruptible paſte, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent to all eternity in the excellencie and goodnes thereof. Wherefore gold cannot bee vanquiſhed by iniurie of time, and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:8737:215"/>
of antiquitie, neither can containe in it ſelfe nor ſupport any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence and ſuperfluitie of ruſt. For though it bee put into the water, or fire, and there remaine for any long ſpace of time, yet is it neuer ſtained, neither doth accept any other quality, but that which is naturall, nor yet doth faile any whit: which is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular priuiledge that it hath aboue other mettalles. For they are all ſubiect to alteration, and therefore change, and corrupt for a ſmall matter, and accept a good or bad qualitie in their originall, or end. But gold is incorruptible, and therefore not ſubiect to ſuch mutations: yea though it bee drawne out in ſo ſmall wire, that it be as fine as threeds in a ſpiders web, and though it be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in moſt piercing medicaments, as are ſublimatum, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degreaſe, ſalt, and vineger, &amp; that it remaine two thouſand yeeres therein, it will not for all that bee corrupted, but contrarywiſe the more refined; but all gold hath not one ſelfe ſame perfection: for their mines and ſources are different in goodnes. Sometimes alſo gold is counterfait, ſophiſticate, and falſified through the infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or auarice of thoſe, who mingle it, and multiplie it with other mixtures of mettals of leſſe value, and leſſe pure then it is. But pure and refined gold is alwaies perfect by nature in all thoſe qualities, which wee haue already touched.<note place="margin">How gold is found.</note> And it is found in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers manners; to wit, mixed with ſand, as in Bohemia: on the ſhore-ſide amongſt the waters neere to Goldebourgh, and Riſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gronde: and amongſt the ſtones in mountaines as in Calecut, and in the Indies. But the firſt generation thereof is at the top of mountaines, in the higheſt places, becauſe that the ſun doth there more eaſily purifie that, which retaineth too much earthines in it. And when the raine, and torrents do flowe downe the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, they carry the gold downe with them to the foote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, where it is gathered amongſt the ſand: or elſe in waters neere thereunto whither it is driuen by violence of the flouds: except perhaps the ground open with thoſe raines, and the gold doe there ſtick, as it oftentimes chaunceth. And that, which is alwaies found in the entrance of the mine, is not the fineſt: but the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you goe, the finer and purer it is, of better waight, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter value. That then which is found in waters and riuers, is fiſhed for and is in forme of little graines: and in rocks and mountaines it is taken out, by deluing and digging.<note place="margin">Three ſorts of gold-mines.</note> And therefore there are holden to bee three ſorts of gold mines. For ſome are called pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſome iacent, and others oblique and running. The pendent
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:8737:216"/>
are thoſe which are found in the ſuperficies of mountaines, and haue the earth vnder them. They which are iacent or lie, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in the fielde and plaine ground, carried thither by torrents and ſtormes of raine. And the other that are oblique, haue a croſſe courſe whether it bee in that which hangeth, or lieth, all whereof is driuen by flouds into the next riuers: for which cauſe there are riuers throughout all the world, the ſand whereof ſeemeth to bee of azure and gold, hauing indeede pure and fine graines of good gold.<note place="margin">How gold is taken out of mines.</note> Now according as the mines are, ſo are there diuers meanes vſed to take out the mettall. For in thoſe places which are dry, without water, they which are expert in the veine of mines, hauing true knowledge what may be in that place, do cauſe it to be digged eight or ten foote deepe, and as many foote long and broad: and as they proceede in their worke, they ſtill waſh the earth that is digged vp, continuing ſo till ſuch time as they finde the gold, which is ſometimes ſo deepe, that they are driuen to ſet vp arches of wood ouer them, that the earth may not ouerwhelm them. And when the mines are pendent along the mountaines, the difficultie is then more great, wherefore they alſo ſet vp en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to defend them from dangers, which are there verie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent. For ſome, to wit, thoſe that dig into the rocke, are quite hidden therein, euen as thoſe that cut ſtone, are within a quarrie; others creepe ſcrambling vp the ſharpe rockes, with a basket at their backes, ſeeking out the earth of the mine to carrie it to the water: others waſh the ſame earth in a ſieue, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the gold is ſeparated, remayning in the ſieue, after that the earth is runne out by little and little. Moreouer, out of theſe mines there iſſueth a ſtinking breath or damp, which doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times choake and kill them that worke therein, being not able to indure ſo bad an aire: ſome alſo are drowned by waters, which ſuddenly guſh out of thoſe places where they haue digged, when they thinke not of any ſuch thing, quickly ouerwhelming them, before they can make ſigne to thoſe that are aboue to helpe them. Againe, theſe miſerable poore ſoules are oftentimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted by euill ſpirits, who inhabite in great numbers in thoſe hollow and ſolitarie places, as many haue experimented to their great hurt. For ſometimes it happeneth, that theſe diuels tumble great ſtones and whole rockes vpon them, throw downe their engines, ouerturne their ladders, breake their cordage, and doe a thouſand other miſchiefes, whereby men are oftentimes ſlaine.
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:8737:216"/>
Concerning riuers wherein the graines and ſands of gold are found, the dangers are not ſo great therein, but the paine is no leſſe. For if the riuer be little, the Indians vſe to emptie and let it out till it be dry: and then take off the bottome thereof, and waſh it, as beforeſaid: and if the water be verie great, they turne it out of the channell; which done, they goe to gather the gold in the midſt of the riuer, betwixt the ſtones and great pibbles, ſo that ſometimes there commeth greater profit by this fiſhing, then by waſhing the digged earth, to ſeparate the gold. But howſoeuer, yet is there great paines alwaies vſed to obtaine the riches of this mettall, ſo much coueted by men, and whereof the abuſe is verie great, as we may in ſome ſort touch, after that we haue ſpoken of other mettals, which ſhall ſerue (AMANA) for the ſubiect of your diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>THE moſt noble amongſt mettals next to gold is ſiluer, for although that copper in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and lead in waight do neereſt approch vnto gold: yet in tenuitie of ſubſtance, in purenes and faſtnes,<note place="margin">Of ſiluer.</note> ſiluer is ſo like vnto it, that good ſiluer may be rightly ſaid to be imperfect gold in ſubſtance, failing in colour, and that by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of time it is ſometimes changed into gold; as in many yeeres ſpace lead turneth into ſiluer. The mines thereof are more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie then gold mines; for Fraunce, Italy, Spaine, England, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, and many other regions of Europe do beare ſiluer in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, as well as the other parts of the world. And it is there engendred in fower manners: to wit, either in the earth, which being gathered together, and then molten in the fire, doth yeeld ſiluer; or in lead, wherwith it is often found mingled; or in braſſe, or in ſtones, out of which it is alſo extracted by fire. For in the mountaine called <hi>(Mons regius)</hi> ſtones retaine verie much ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: which being alſo put into the fire, there is found in euerie pound of ſiluer that runneth out of them, halfe an ounce of gold at leaſt. Siluer is alſo many times found to be mixed with copper, as in Alſaria neer to the Rhine, in the mountaines of Saint <hi>Anne,</hi>
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:8737:217"/>
and in Meiſſen: for there are ſtones full of copper, in which is great abundance of ſiluer. And when it is ſeparated from lead, it leaueth a ſcumme,<note place="margin">Of litharge.</note> which we call <hi>(Lithargyrium)</hi> which is a kinde of impure lead,<note place="margin">Of quickſiluer.</note> retayning ſome vertue of ſiluer. For quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluer, though it agree in name with ſiluer, yet it approcheth nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to gold: for it is like vnto it in tenuitie, and waight, and to ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in colour onely. But for all this it is no mettall, but a water condenſate, not by heat (for it is not hardned) nor by cold (for then it would be a ſtone or mettall) but by ſome other terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, rare and pure portion, wherby it commeth to be verie waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and cold, ſplendent and liquide: and is therefore rancked among thoſe mettalline ſubſtances, which differ but little from water: and indeed the mountaines where quickſiluer groweth are verie greene, and full of fountaines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of amber.</note>Let vs ſpeake now of Amber, which wee haue put into the number of mettals. Many authors do diſagree verie much in the diſcourſe of Amber. For ſome reckon that which is called <hi>(Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum)</hi> amongſt pliable and hard mettalline ſubſtances: others will not acknowledge it to be any other then a gumme of a tree, which is verie much like to that of the Pine and Fir-tree, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Roſin, and is verie common in Arabia the happie. <hi>Philemon</hi> writeth, that in two places of Scythia, Amber is digged out of the ground, like a kinde of ſtone; and in one place it is white, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yealow. But omitting this argument, we will follow thoſe who make Amber a mettall, whoſe nature and propertie is in meane betwixt gold and ſiluer: and that ſuch is the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural amber; as that, which we vſe in our beads is artificial. And it partaketh more of gold then of ſiluer, becauſe it is more pure and perfect, and apt to be wrought. For if it did conſiſt more of ſiluer, it could not endure the forge and hammer. There are veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels made thereof for beautie and profit: for good amber doth diſcouer poyſons in theſe two manners, by cracking and making the ſigne of an arch within. For when the rare humiditie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commeth to be conſumed by the force of venim, it cracketh: and the colour changing, it ſeemeth that in ſteed of the great ſplendor thereof, there doth a kinde of ſtaine repreſent it ſelfe like vnto an arch. Now that this kinde of amber is verie rare, it is not becauſe there is not enough to be had in mines: but auarice and ignorance of the vertue thereof cauſeth that the gold is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, whereby it ceaſeth to be amber.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="417" facs="tcp:8737:217"/>Concerning Iron; it is taken out of the earth,<note place="margin">Of iron.</note> and to make it malleable, the maſſe thereof is (when it is taken vp) laid to drie in the ſunne, and that which is earthy doth ſoften in the raine, as that which is moiſt doth melt by the ſun, and the moſt ſharp part thereof, which is as the venim of it, is conſumed by the fire. The mines of this mettall are common in Europe, as in diuers parts of France, which are enriched by the forges that are there ſet vp, to bring this minerall ſubſtance to his perfection. Which by how much the more it is concocted and purged, by ſo much the more is it better in goodnes: in ſuch ſort, as that which is earthy, doth at laſt turne to ſcales and droſſe, and the moſt ſubtile part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth conuert into ſteele, after it hath beene well purged, and a little marble added thereto. And this is artificiall ſteele.<note place="margin">Of ſteele.</note> For there is in many places naturall ſteele, namely in Perſia very good, in the Chaldean Iſle, and neere Damaſcus, whereof the beſt cemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the world are made, which cut ſo well, that there is no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor bee it neuer ſo well ſteeled and tempered that hath a more fine and ſharper edge. For this cauſe ſome ſay that there are ſome kindes of ſteele and iron ſo excellent, that waight for waight they are eſteemed of greater price then gold. Moreouer men may ſee what art can doe in iron, when by much beating thereof, and through the power of water, iron, bee it neuer ſo thin, is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frangible by blowes: becauſe that ſuch water, by meanes of fire doth conſume the terreſtriall and waterie excrement, which is found in this mettall. When then the iron is brought to be moſt pure, moſt hard, and moſt light, then is it moſt ſubtile, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt ſtrong, and reſiſteth beſt.</p>
                  <p>Lead conſiſteth of foure kindes. For there is black, common,<note place="margin">Of lead.</note> &amp; low-pricked lead: white, which is ordinarily called tinne: <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemutum</hi> which is of meane quality betwixt black and white, and is rare, and knowne but to few people though it bee found in the mountaines of Bohemia: and the fourth kind is compounded of Stibium. The ore of lead is molten in furnaces prepared for that purpoſe, and beeing molten, it is let runne through pipes out of the furnace, whither the workmen will. And whileſt it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth very hot, they caſt cleere water vpon it to make the foure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe: which waxeth very maſſiue, hard to breake, yealow, and bright as glaſſe: and this is that which is called litharge of lead. But this difference is betwixt white lead, and true tinne;<note place="margin">Of tinne.</note> that this doth alwaies grow with ſiluer, &amp; the other doth grow of it ſelfe: in
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:8737:218"/>
ſuch ſort that tinne is almoſt white lead blaunched by ſiluer. Braſſe (as wee haue already ſaid) is made of a matter verie neere approching to that of iron:<note place="margin">Of braſſe, and copper.</note> and ſo alſo is copper. But braſſe hath this propertie, that it neuer ruſteth; as iron and ſteele doth: and therefore it will continue longer. In times paſt alſo, it was verie vſuall to make armor and bucklers thereof, yea, and launces like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: witnes <hi>Homer,</hi> who recounteth that <hi>Menelaus</hi> purſued Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris with a braſen launce. Flutes and pipes of organes, and other muſicall inſtruments are commonly made of braſſe: but it doth properly agree with trumpets, becauſe it maketh a great noiſe in dorick muſicke, and inflameth men to combat. That of cyprus is harder, and better then any other. Some alſo becauſe of copper make two kindes of braſſe: to wit, naturall, whereof the beſt hath ſpots of ſhining gold intermingled; and there is reported to haue bin found in new Spaine in America a peece of it of two hundred pound waight. Then is there artificial braſſe, which is called cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or latten: and the moſt excellent is that, which in fower pounds of braſſe doth containe one pound of white lead called tinne: alſo when the white lead is mixed to the eight part of braſſe, then is the copper very good: but it is baſe beeing mixed with black lead. For the vſe of copper, it is chiefly fit for faire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, as ordinance, cauldrons, and ſuch like: wherein it is more excellent then braſſe; becauſe alſo it doth not giue a bad taſt, nor ſmell to ſuch meat as is boiled therein. Thus haue wee ſummarily runne ouer that, which wee thought moſt conuenient to bee ſpoken concerning mettals: wee will now ſpeake of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones: whereof (ARAM) do you begin to entreate.</p>

Now the originall of ſtones, as of mettals, is in the earth: and they bee all made of an elementarie ſubſtance, or of a pure and equall matter which is gathered togither, or elſe is runne on an heape, or elſe hath beene purified in ſome ſort howſoeuer. In which,<note place="margin">Of the originall, and ſubſtance of ſtones.</note> heat doth chiefly operate. For that is it which boileth the matter naturallie engendred to perfect the humor, whereof af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:8737:218"/>
the minerall matter or ſtone doth conſiſt. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> diſtinguiſhing al that which doth ſo grow within the earth, ſaith, that ſome things participate with the water, as gold, and ſiluer, and other mettals: ſome accord with the earth, as ſtones, yea pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, and all ſuch earths as are in eſtimation becauſe of their colours, or of their ſauors, or of ſome other properties. But if he would infer (as it ſeemeth) that all precious ſtones are terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall, if this opinion were true, then ſhould there be no precious ſtone bright &amp; cleere, &amp; yet almoſt al of them are ſo. Wherefore we may rather ſay, that they are not earthie, but watry: that is to ſay, that they are compoſed of a certaine humor, which retaineth more of water then of earth: for it is a certaine kinde of clammy ſlime, wherein there is more water then earth, which being dried and thickned through contiunance of the ſame operation, and by the vehemencie thereof, doth at laſt become a ſtone. Now that a groſſe and clammy humour doth eaſily conuert into ſtone, we ſee euident in all liuing creatures, and chiefly in our ſelues. For thoſe ſtones and grauell, which breed in the bladder and in the reines, are ingendred of ſuch humours, as in tract of time haue beene boyled and hardned by the naturall heat of our bodie. So then precious ſtones, which are bright and tranſparent, are not compoſed of earth, nor yet of water onely: but are ingendred of a pure and liquid humour, which retaineth in it ſelfe more of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then of earth. For in that theſe ſtones, being caſt into water, ſinke to the bottome, it is manifeſt, that they are not made of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely, for then they ſhould ſwim aloft like yee and haile.</p>
                  <p>For the ſplendor and light of ſome, and obſcuritie,<note place="margin">Of the ſplendor and light in ſtones.</note> or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of others: we muſt firſt note, that the elements operating (as in all things elſe) in the generation of ſtones, they participate more with the water and with the earth, then with the fire and with the aire. And becauſe that the earth is not tranſparent nor ſhining, as it is euident that the water is, &amp; cleer alſo; it followeth, that al the brightnes &amp; ſplendor of ſtones, doth proceed from the water. Therfore we ſay, that al cleere &amp; tranſparent ſtones are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of humours alike in cleernes &amp; light: and contrariwiſe, that they which are troubled, obſcure &amp; thicke, do proceed from the earth: to wit, from a ſlimie &amp; blacke humour that retayneth much earth, and but little water. And for ſo much as ſome ſtones are more cleere, and more ſhining then others, that proceedeth from the diuerſitie of humors, whereof they haue bin engendred:

for ſome humors are more cleere and more purified then others. Whereupon enſueth that ſome precious ſtones which are white, haue beene generated by an humour hauing the colour of water, which maketh them more cleere and more tranſparent then others: and ſo of the varietie which is in the colours of all ſtones, be they greene, blew, red, purple, yealow, or of many mingled colours, one muſt iudge the humours whereof they did proceed at firſt to haue beene ſuch: and that other precious ſtones which are not tranſparent proceed from troubled, blacke and obſcure humours; for the water it ſelfe though it be neuer ſo cleere, doth become blacke, if it be mixed with neuer ſo little blacknes. And ſuch precious ſtones as are ſplendant, do ſhine by reaſon of their great brightnes, which maketh their light continue and abound. As much muſt we iudge of the cauſe of ſtaines, ſpots, ſhadowings, cloudes, vaines and other vices, which are found in precious ſtones: and of the difference that is in their maſſiuenes, ſpungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, lightnes, waight and hardnes: for all theſe things proceed from the diuerſitie of the nature and of the colours of ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours as haue engendred them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſtones, and of their proper praiſes.</note>Now amongſt precious ſtones, theſe beare away the priſe, and are praiſed with eſpeciall praiſe: the white diamond, for hardnes, and ſoliditie: the greene emerauld for beawty: the red carbuncle, called the rubie, for liuely colour: the skie coloured ſaphir, for grace: the yealow chryſolite for ſplendor: the diuers coloured opall, for varietie: and the cleere pearle for whitenes, and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Firſt then let vs ſpeake of the diamond.<note place="margin">Of the diamond.</note> For as gold amongſt mettals, ſo the diamond amongſt ſtones is moſt precious. For the ſubſtance thereof is hard, and for that cauſe the more exquiſite: as that is amongſt mettals, which is the moſt pliable. By reaſon then of the hardnes and ſoliditie thereof, the diamond beareth away the price amongſt precious ſtones: for in colour it is inferior to the emeraulde, to the rubie, and to the opall. But that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it moſt to bee eſteemed, is, becauſe that the filings, and ſmall peeces thereof are precious: ſo that one ſcruple is ſold for ſixe crownes of gold: and becauſe that by the hardnes thereof, it cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all other ſtones, beeing not onely commodious in ſculpture but alſo very neceſſarie. Neither will it bee well cut or poliſhed, but by the onely filings thereof, ſo hard it is. For which cauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue written, that the point of a dart, beeing rubbed with the pouder of a diamond, it will eaſily pierce any armor: wherein this
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:8737:219"/>
reaſon is apparant, that the iron or ſteele is heated by the blowe, whereupon it may be penetrated by the ſubtilitie and hardnes of the diamond. Which is alſo commended for this vertue, that being poliſhed, it doth greatly gliſter amongſt precious ſtones: &amp; for that it reſiſteth fire for the ſpace of nine daies time, without hauing any ſenſe therof, and afterwards it remaineth many other daies, without being annoyed. Which ſufficiently declareth that this ſtone doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt of moſt ſubtile parts: for otherwiſe it would haue pores &amp; ſmal holes, by which the fire entring, it ſhould eaſily breake. The diamond then retayneth a liuely and ſtrong ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, in ſuch ſort that it doth not only ſhine, but doth alſo ſparkle, and is beſides that, vnchangeable, not being corrupted by iron, by moiſture, by fire, by age, nor by vſe. It hath alſo this property, that being tied to the fleſh of the left arm, it doth hinder &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the feares of night. It is not then without good cauſe that this ſtone is ſo much eſteemed by vs, and almoſt by all nations. For euen in the Indies, in Calicut, in Perſia, in Tartaria, and other places, where rocks of Diamonds are commonly found, they are verie deere and of great trafficke: ſo that they are tranſported into all places, how far remote ſoeuer they be: witnes the iſle of Carge, which lyeth in the boſome of the Perſian-ſea, where bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines are vſually made for Diamond ſtone: it remayning yet vncut from the rocke, although it be ſcarce within ſixe hundred and threeſcore miles of that place where it is had. And therefore it is no great maruel, if diamonds be at ſo high a price as they are, conſidering that they are ſo much in requeſt by euerie one: wherefore there are ſome found which are ſold for twentie and thirtie thouſand crownes a piece and aboue; for we our ſelues know, that there is one in the treaſurie of our kings which did coſt ſeuentie thouſand crownes. Wee are to note, that in the mountaine of Cugarquel, which is neer to the riuer of Goa in the Eaſt Indies, are the beſt and fineſt diamonds of all the world: as to the contrarie in the iſle of Canada, which neighboureth vpon Florida, there are found falſe ones, but ſo faire and well cut by nature, that the moſt ſubtile Lapidaries are verie much troubled to diſcerne the one from the other: whereupon this Prouerbe did ariſe. Loe, theres a Canada-diamond. But I haue ſaid enough hereof. Now (ACHITOB) doe you ſpeake of the nature and propertie of other precious ſtones.</p>

                  <p>THE Emeraud hath beene long time hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for the moſt precious ſtone of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well becauſe of the beautie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as by reaſon of the manie great properties which are naturall thereunto: in ſuch ſort as the price therof did exceed that of the diamond. But as the rarenes of ſome things make them deere, ſo doth the abundance of other things make them to be leſſe eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: as it came to paſſe,<note place="margin">Of the eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raud.</note> that the great quantitie of Emerauds, which not long ſince were found in the new-found countries of America, hath much abated their price, but not their beautie nor vertue, which euer remayneth, and is moſt excellent in thoſe which are brought out of the Eaſt-Indies: for they of Peru are of much leſſe woorth. The greene Emeraud then is the faireſt of all precious ſtones, but yet the moſt brittle. For it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to breake euen in the act of coiture. Being drunke, it doth much reſiſt poyſons, by the nature of the ſoftnes thereof: by reaſon that the abundance of the well concocted humour which is therein, doth refreſh the ſpirit by the perſpicuitie thereof: and ſo it is profitable to the nature of man, and reſiſteth the force of venim: and for ſo much as it is a ſtone it retayneth the vertue thereof ſtable. For we may note, that all things which are pleaſant to the ſight, are profitable for man; whether it be in precious ſtones, or gold, or ſiluer, ſilke or purple: but aboue all, the Emeraud is faire, if that the art therein deceiue not the ſight, for as well this ſtone, as others are oftentimes counterfeited and falſified in diuers ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ers. Moreouer, as the Emeraud is verie ſoft, ſo is it verie ſubiect to all caſual chaunces: for it is corrupted by fire and heat, and by the touch of other precious ſtones which are harder, chiefly of the Diamond, yea by euerie thing that can giue a blow. That which ſhineth moſt, and almoſt like the ſunne, and which refreſheth the ſight, as forreſts and greene medowes doe, is moſt to be eſteemed. But I beleeue there was neuer any mention made of a more rich baſin then that of an Emeraud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the greateſt treaſures of Italie, which is in the citie of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:8737:220"/>
Genoa: for it is reported that it was pawned in the neceſſitie of the common-weale for fourteene hundred thouſand ducats: thinke then but how much this Emeraud muſt bee woorth. But that which is alſo ſaid, that this is the ſame platter, wherin our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt did eat the Paſchal Lamb in his laſt ſupper, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me to doubt much, whether there be any people that vpon one onely ſtone would lend ſo great a ſumme of money.</p>
                  <p>The red Carbuncle called the ruby is another precious ſtone,<note place="margin">Of the carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle called the rubie.</note> which is verie beautifull, and hath the propertie to quicken the ſpirite, and make it ioyfull. Some authors haue made mention of three kinds of carbuncles, ſaying that there be ſome, which ſhine in the darke: others alſo that ſhine, if water bee powred thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the third kinde is of thoſe, whoſe cleerenes is onely ſeene in another light, to wit by day time, or by candle light. <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> ſaith, that there are ſome of the colour of water, ſome of the colour of the Amethyſt, others of the colour of the Iacinth, and ſome of a red colour, which are called Rubies. In the Indies theſe ſtones are plentifully found: and <hi>Lewes de Barthema</hi> reporteth, that the king of <hi>Pegum,</hi> which is a citie in India, hath carbuncles called in Greeke <hi>Pyropi,</hi> of ſuch magnitude and ſplendor, that if any one ſhould ſee the king in a darke place, with theſe ſtones vpon him, he would ſeeme to ſhine like a cleere light, euen as if he were fired by the beames of the ſunne.</p>
                  <p>The ſaphir doth approch neere to the excellencie of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond, in great hardnes: in fairenes of colour,<note place="margin">Of the ſaphir.</note> beeing of a skie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and in beawtie: and is very good for the ſight if it bee not ſophiſticated. It refreſheth a man, and beeing drunke is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for melancholy people, and for blowes &amp; bitings of ſcorpions and ſerpents. <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> affirmeth that he had twiſe found by experience, that the ſaphir would heale an anthrax, which is a kinde of bile. Which may be beleeued conſidering the medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vertue which is in this ſtone. For as thirſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth through the biting of a certaine ſnake called <hi>Dipſas,</hi> and as the hand is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed by the touching of a little fiſh, called <hi>Remora,</hi> ſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous fire of the <hi>Anthrax</hi> may bee extinguiſhed by the long touching of the ſaphir: but it muſt needes bee ſo big as it may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the head of the bile.</p>
                  <p>Hauing already made mention of the Iacinth, and of the ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſt, to which there are great properties aſſigned, I will now touch ſome principall points in them. And firſt wee are to note,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:8737:221"/>
that the iacinth is commonly of a yealow colour, but the beſt is red: yet it is not ſo big as the other: beeing put into the fire it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth more obſcure, and redder: and beeing out of the fire it ſhineth greatly. Alſo this kinde of hyacinth doth differ but little from the carbuncle in eſtimation of price. They that are of the colour of water are counted for baſe, and of no force. But <hi>Serapio</hi> hath written, that the good iacinth keepeth men that beareth it out of the peril of thunder: and defendeth them from the plague, and prouoketh ſleepe. <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> likewiſe ſaith, that the iacinth doth augment riches, and authoritie, and that it doth greatly comfort the hart, and cauſe much ioy. Now becauſe theſe things might ſeeme to be paradoxes to many, we will here make a little diſcourſe, following the precept of the philoſopher, who thinketh it ſufficient in hard and intricate queſtions, if wee can well auoide and ſhun abſurd doctrine. For by this meanes many ſhal be induced to eſteeme more then they do of precious ſtones, and to beleeue the properties, which are attributed vnto them, if not as true,<note place="margin">Good reaſons of the vertue of ſtones.</note> at leaſt wiſe yet as poſſible. I ſay then that the iacinth is of cold temperature: for that is almoſt common to all precious ſtones, and cauſeth them, eſpeciallie the diamond, not to receiue fire very eaſily: forſomuch as the coldnes doth greatly helpe the ſoliditie and ſubtiltie thereof, which maketh that ſtones do reſiſt fire. Beſides the iacinth is good for the breath of man, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the likenes of ſubſtance, or by cleerenes, or through ſome other myſticall cauſe, whereby repairing and confirming the breath and the ſpirit, it maketh man ioyfull: for ſadnes is nothing elſe but the contraction of breath, and ſhortnes and difficultie of the ſame. By ſuch reaſon then, as ſome haue ſaid that they haue experimented, that if any thing doe comfort the heart, it doth likewiſe reſiſt the plague, which doth chiefly come through feare and imbecillitie of heart (as experience ſheweth vs in regard of children, women, and fearefull people, who are ſooner taken with this diſeaſe, then ſtout and hardie men:) the Iacinth aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing theſe two things (feare and faintnes of heart) it may, I ſay, helpe greatly to reſiſt the plague. So alſo making the heart and the ſpirit ioyful, and by that meanes more capable of good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, it ſhall be the eaſier for man to encreaſe in authoritie, and to augment in richeſſe. For being defended from thunder, although that the Iacinth be (as we haue ſaid) of cold temper, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that it will not eaſily receiue endomagement by fire: yet do
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:8737:221"/>
not we attribute to it therefore, that it will preſerve a man from being hurt. But we may rather ſay, that the ſpirit of his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reioyced by the vertue of this ſtone, may haue the grace to direct him into ſome place where he may be cleane out of the perill of thunder. Concerning the Amethyſt,<note place="margin">Of the ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſt.</note> it is alſo a precious ſtone and orientall, although it be but of a low price in regard of others: in it is ſeene the colour and grace of wine, bearing a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple luſtre: and it is thought to hinder drunkennes if it be tyed to the nauell; and to ſtir vp dreames. Now (ASER) let vs heare you purſue our diſcourſe of ſtones.</p>

                  <p>VVHoſoeuer will neerely conſider vpon that, which hath beene written by the Ancients concerning the Chryſolite and Topaze,<note place="margin">Of the chryſolite.</note> ſhal finde that that, which wee call a Chryſolite, was their Topaze, and contrariwiſe our Topaze was their Chryſolite. This ſtone is of yellow colour, not pure, but greeniſh, and is nothing inferiour to the Saphir in hardnes, if it be orientall. For you muſt note, that the Germaine Chryſolite, and many other pretious ſtones, which are found vnder the North, cold, Septentrionall Zone, are not ſo hard as the orientall; becauſe that there the heat is not ſo ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that it may much attenuate the humour, which compoſeth the ſtone, and harden it: for the perfect concretion and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together is the cauſe of hardnes, which is done, when ſome verie ſmall parts are mixed and conioyned together, as commeth to paſſe in the generation of euerie ſtone. Moreouer the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolite is ſeldome found, without ſome blacke ſpots wherewith it is foyled: and but for this, it is a verie excellent precious ſtone. It is thought greatly to repreſſe luſt, if it be carried next to ones skin. Beſides, it is of great coldnes, whereby this argument is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that being laide vpon the toong of one that hath a feuer, it appeaſeth his thirſt. <hi>Plinie</hi> recordeth,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 37. c. 8.</note> that from an Iſle called To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazos, there was brought a Chryſolite to Queene <hi>Berenice,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of king <hi>Ptolemey</hi> the ſecond, which was fower cubites long: and that the king of Egypt did afterwards cauſe a ſtatue to be

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the opall.</note>Now ſpeake we of the Opall, which for varietie of colours is accounted amongſt the moſt precious ſtones. For in it the fire of the Rubie, the purple of the Amethyſt, and the greene ſea of the Emeraud, ſhine altogether by a maruellous kinde of mixture. There are ſome which haue a luſtre ſo mixed with all colours, that there can no more be ſeene in a rich tablet nor more liuely. Others ſeeme to ſparkle with violet flames, changing in manner of a fire made of brimſtone, or of a fire kindled with oyle. <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, that the Greekes did call the Opall, <hi>Paederos,</hi> that is to ſay, paſtime for little children,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. lib. 17. c. 6. &amp; .9.</note> becauſe of the great grace and beautie which this ſtone hath in it. For (ſaith he) firſt one would ſay that there were a greene heauen in a pure chryſtal, mixed with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple colour, and a golden luſtre, enclining to the colour of wine, which is alwaies the laſt colour that doth preſent it ſelfe. And yet one would ſay that this ſtone hath the head crowned with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple chaplet, and that it is confuſedly tincted with all theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide colours, and reſpectiuely with each of them. Moreouer, there is no ſtone more cleere then this: and ſome ſay that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good for the head, and comfortable to the ſight. <hi>Nonius</hi> a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour of Rome did ſo loue an Opall that he had, that he choſe rather to be baniſhed out of Rome, then to giue it to <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> carrying nothing with him of all his wealth but the ring onely, wherein that ſtone was ſet. Opals are found in many places of Egypt, of Arabia, and of the Indies: but the beſt are brought from Zeila, and Iſle of Eaſt India, which produceth them as great as walnuts. But we muſt note, that the Indians can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit them ſo finely with ſimple glaſſe, that it is an hard matter to diſcerne the natural, from falſe ones: yet their deceit is found in the ſunne. For holding betwixt the thumbe and fore-finger a falſe Opall againſt the ſunne, all the diuerſitie of colours which ſeemed to be in this ſtone will turne into one: But the naturall
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:8737:222"/>
Opall changeth luſtre euerie minute, and ſpreadeth it heere and there, ſo that the diuerſitie of the colours thereof will ſhine vpon your fingers, beeing holden (as is ſaide) and expoſed to the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>Shall we ſay nothing of the Turkeſſe which is garniſhed with the colour of heauen, and which hath admirable vertue?<note place="margin">Of the turkeſſe.</note> For it is of a skie colour and celeſtiall blewe, and verie bright. It is eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe that in the night it likewiſe looketh greene: that part which is vpon the earth is marked with veines: it is ſoft, and not of too cold a ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Alſo lime ſlaked &amp; laid vpon this ſtone, ſeemeth to be blew, and receiueth the colour of a precious ſtone. It is commonly made bunching, and ſwelling out like an eie: and is found in this forme ſowed and ſet along the rocks in many places of the Indies: but the faireſt Turkeſſes are in the kingdom of Raſigut. And becauſe of the difficultie to come to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they grow, the inhabitants of the countrey beat them downe with ſtaues, in ſuch ſort that they fall with their earth and moſſe: and the people doe eſteeme ſo much of them, that they account them as their greateſt riches and delight, hanging them about their necks in manner of Carcanets. It is no maruell then if theſe ſtones bee rare amongſt vs: for wee ſee no verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon trafficke made of them, and yet they are much in requeſt at this day. Their vertue and propertie according to the report of ſome, is verie maruellous. For they ſay, that the Turkeſſe being worne in a ring, doth keepe a man from hurt that falleth, yea though it be from his horſe: and that it receiueth all the blow, and is oftentimes broken in pieces: which is leſſe credible then that which ſome alſo affirme, that the vertue thereof doth reſiſt poyſons.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſpeake of the Agath,<note place="margin">Of the agath.</note> which is the biggeſt of all ſuch as are called precious ſtones. But it is of ſo variable a kinde, that one can ſcarcely thinke it to be one onely ſtone. For the Agath is white, red, yellow, aſh-coloured, greene, black, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, blew: in briefe, the colours of all precious ſtones, and of all other beſides do concur in it. And nature exerciſeth ſo many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions vpon it, that we may ſee it repreſent forreſts, fields, floods, flowers &amp; trees. Hiſtories haue celebrated verie much the Agath of king <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> which repreſented the nine Muſes, with <hi>Apollo</hi> in the middeſt of them playing vpon his harp, beeing all in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie garments: in ſuch ſort, as it ſeemed that nature did contend
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:8737:223"/>
with the painter to carry away the price of ſuch a repreſentation. <hi>Cardanus</hi> reporteth that hee had in his keeping two Agaths,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. de. ſubt.</note> in one of which, nature had painted the hemiſphere of heauen, the diſtinct circles, with the round earth in the midſt, enuironed by the waters: and in the other, an open gulf of the earth, ſeemed to breath out a fume that darkened the aire: wherein this was moſt admirable, that the colour of the ſmoke ſhould ſeeme to differ from that of the aire, which was thereby darkened: this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring white, and thick, and the aire reddiſh, and ſomewhat cleere. But though the agath bee noble and excellent for the varietie thereof, yet becauſe it is but little bright, and ſhining, it is but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome eſteemed to bee of great valew amongſt precious ſtones. Some doe attribute this propertie thereto, to bee good againſt ſtingings of ſcorpio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: eſpecially that Agath which is ſpotted with little graines of gold, which the Iſles of Candie, and Sicilie doe produce. The ſame vertue is attributed to the agaths of India and to refreſh the ſight much, by but onely looking vpon them: and they ſay, that they ſtaunch thirſt beeing held neuer ſo ſhort a while in ones mouth. But enough of this: now (AMANA) doe you looke to that, which reſteth for vs to conſider vpon, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe moſt precious ſtones that deſerue to enrich our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

conditions. Concerning the generation thereof, the ancient opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath euer beene, that the pearle was engendred in ſhelles of fiſhes, wherewith the Indian ſea doth abound, which engendring at one time of the yeere, doe open and gape in the night time, by that meanes filling themſelues with dewe, whereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue pearles, which they make according to the qualitie of the dewe receiued: if it bee cleere, they are cleere: if troubled ſo, are they troubled, and fowle: if aboundant, the pearles are great: if ſcarce, they are little. Moreouer if it happen to thunder the ſhels ſhut togither for feare that they haue; ſo that they haue no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to take in dewe enough, whereby they remaine lanck and emptie, as if they had faſted: and thereof alſo pearles do proceed that are without ſubſtance, and full of winde. But marke what our French coſmographer ſaith:<note place="margin">Lib. 10. de. coſm. c. 4.</note> if theſe ſhels or oiſters haue no other ſubſtance within them, but this pearle ſo conceiued of dew, how doth the race of this ſhell-fiſh maintaine it ſelfe? Moreouer in the weſt Indian ſeas, where aboundance of theſe pearles are found, it cannot bee ſeene how their generation may bee iudged by the cleere, or obſcure diſpoſition of the weather: for if that were ſo, there is no doubt, but that all the pearles, which were found in one ſhell, ſhould be all of one manner: whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is ſeene, that within one ſhell are found ſome darke pearles, others drawing to a tawnie, ſome pale, ſome greeniſh, and ſome againe blewiſh, and very few there are, which haue the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required in a faire pearle. Thereupon he concludeth, that this pearled fiſh maintaineth the kinde thereof by the egs which it breedeth: and that the pearles come out of the ſand and grauell wherein they breede and are hidden: becauſe that by little and little this grauell refineth it ſelfe, and groweth into theſe ſhels, or oiſters, till ſuch time as it hath attained to an entire and perfect forme, remaining ſtill ſoft, for ſo long time as the oiſter is within the water, but beeing out, it preſently hardneth, and becommeth ſuch pearle as wee ſee. But without much diſputing hereupon, euery man is of opinion, that theſe pearles are bred in the ſhels of fiſhes. And the experience hereof is not onely ſeene in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ſea, but alſo in the Britiſh ſeas, yea in all ſeas, and freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: becauſe that ſuch oiſters do ſwim aſwell as fiſhes: of which there haue beene ſome fiſhed vp in the riuer Garonne. But the induſtry of ſuch as fiſh, for them in the bottome of the ſea is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull: for from thence they fetch their beſt mother of pearle,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:8737:224"/>
which lie within, and vpon rocks hidden in the waters. They which are appointed to ſuch fiſhing, enter into boats, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (leauing ſome within to gouerne them, and to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo vp, when they haue done their fiſhing) they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the water, diuing downe to the bottome, where they ſometimes remaine for the ſpace of halfe an hower, and with nets catch theſe ſhels: hauing taken ſome, they returne againe to the top of the water, and are receiued by thoſe in the veſſell, where refreſhing themſelues with meat, and drinke, and hauing fitted on that, which they put before their face, which is, as of little pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſeare cloth very fine like a thinne bladder, made that they may ſee cleerely through within the water; they leap in fiue, or ſix times a day. Theſe oiſters are alſo found faſtned vpon rocks, which appeare aboue water, from whence they are fetched with paine, and beeing catched, the pearles are ſtraightwaies taken out, which otherwiſe would conſume and loſe their freſh colour: and in one ſhell there are ſometimes thirty, or forty ſmall and meane ones, but few great ones, to wit, one, or two. They were, doubtleſſe,<note place="margin">Pearles of great price.</note> woonderfull faire, which were giuen to <hi>Ferdinand Magellano,</hi> in a certaine Iſle of the Moluccaes, which were fower in number, each one of the bignes of a pigeons egge, eſteemed to bee woorth fiue and twentie thouſand crownes a peece. But this was a very ſmal matter in compariſon to the two Vnions of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi> Queene of Egypt, eſteemed woorth fifteene hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes: one whereof ſhe diſſolued in very ſtrong vineger, and dranke it vp at a banket, becauſe it might bee ſaid, that ſhee had ſurpaſſed in ſumptuouſnes of coſt, the feaſt which <hi>Anthonie</hi> had made hir. Now for the vertues of pearles, they are very good for paſſions, and faintnes of hart, and purge the bloud, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into medicines, they take away clowdes, and dimnes from before the eies, and drie vp the moiſture that runnes from them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of corall.</note>Corall is likewiſe fiſhed for in the ſea, and put into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtones, although indeed it is a plant, or ſhrubbe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawne out of the Mediterranean ſea, and feeling the aire, doth waxe hard by the power thereof. And there is found, white, red and blacke, in one ſelfe ſame plant, which groweth amongſt ſtones and rocks in the bottome of the water: but the beſt coral is the red if it be euenly congealed: for the white is not ſo maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue nor heauie: but is light, rare, and full of holes like a ſpunge.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:8737:224"/>
When it is fiſhed for, it is all couered with moſſe, and hath no ſigne or apparition of rednes. But being clenſed, it taketh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and appeereth fairely poliſhed: now thoſe graines of round corall, which are put in bracelets and collers, are not found ſo in the ſhrubbe: but it conſiſteth of many little branches, whereof theſe graines are made with a wheele, and files, and are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards poliſhed with vermilion, &amp; with a certaine earth which is brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tripoly in Africa. The properties which are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to coral, are marueilous: for ſome ſay, that being ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged about the necke, or taken in drinke, it is good for them that haue the falling euill, for bloodie flixes and looſenes of the belly, to faſten the teeth, to heale ſorenes in the mouth: to prouoke ſleepe in ſuch as haue feuers, to diminiſh the ſpleene: for thoſe that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite and ſpit bloud. <hi>Auicen</hi> placeth it amongſt thoſe medicines that comfort the hart, and <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith that being burnt and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerized, and ſo drunke with water, it is good for them that haue wringing in their belly, and the ſtone in the bladder. The aſhes thereof alſo are put into medicines for the eies: it thickneth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerateth, and doth incarnate hollow vlcers, and maketh skars ſmooth. But amongſt other properties this is moſt admirable and true, that red corall, which is pure and fulgent like the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, being tyed about ones necke ſo that it touch the skinne, when that perſon is ſicke, or ſhall be in ſhort ſpace after, or hath drunke any venim, which he yet feeleth not, the corall doth wax pale and loſe the ſplendor thereof: which <hi>Cardanus</hi> hath often teſtified to haue prooued by experience.</p>
                  <p>I will hereto adde ſome ſhort diſcourſe concerning Chryſtall:<note place="margin">Of chryſtall.</note> becauſe that as it is engendred in the veines of the earth, of the ſame humour that the Diamond is, which opened the entrance of this diſcourſe concerning precious ſtones; ſo now this ſpeech of Chryſtall may ſhut it vp againe. <hi>Plinie</hi> and many others haue ſuppoſed that it was made of yce or ſnow: in a word, that it was water congealed through great cold. But it appeereth that chryſtall is engendred of ſome verie wel purified humour, in that it is the cleereſt of all ſtones. Againe, if the oldeſt yce in the world be put into an hot place, it doth preſently melt, which chryſtall doth not. Moreouer, it is moſt certaine that it is not found on the tops of mountaines, where there is continuall ſnow and extreme coldnes: but in quarries of marble and of other ſtones, yea and in mines of diuers mettals. This alſo is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:8737:225"/>
reaſon, that yce doth alwaies ſwimme aboue water, but chryſtall ſinketh to the bottome. That chryſtall is beſt, which is white and cleere as water. It melteth with verie great fire, and doth conuert into glaſſe, whereof there are verie faire veſſels made. In vertue it is reſtringent, and is therefore good for ſuch as are ſicke of Dyſenterias to drinke, in good ſharp wine, after it is wel and ſubtilly beaten to powder. The Ancients made a bowle of chryſtall, wherewith phiſitions cauterized thoſe which feared the fire, and common fearing iron: to do which, they laide the ſame bowle directly toward the beames of the ſunne: by the reuerberation whereof they did their ſurgerie worke vpon the grieued part. Now in this little which we (companions) haue declared concerning mettals and precious ſtones, we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that if there be ſufficient matter to admire the effects of nature, ordayned by the diuine prouidence, what might we thinke, if we ſhould enterpriſe to ſpeake of fiue hundred kindes of mettals, earths, and precious ſtones, which the earth hideth within her bowels? But ſith that we haue attayned to the ende of our diſcourſe, which is to glorifie God in the knowledge and contemplation of his moſt noble creatures: let vs aduiſe our ſelues how to giue ſome good inſtructions vpon that which hath beene deliuered concerning minerals and ſtones hidden vnder ground as (ARAM) you can declare vnto vs.</p>

                  <p>AS God declareth a great and maruellous proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all his creatures (as we haue diſcourſed intreating vpon them) ſo alſo doth he manifeſt it vnto vs in the creation of mettals, &amp; eſpecially of gold &amp; ſiluer, which are eſteemed for the moſt precious. For we ſee how he hath hidden them in the moſt deepe places of the earth, &amp; hath couered them with great and high mountaines: ſo that to dig and draw them out of their profound caues, men muſt therein ſo trauell, as if they had enterpriſed to ouerturne and to tranſport theſe loftie hils from one place to another, and to ſearch and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:8737:225"/>
pierce through the earth from one ſide to another. For how is it ſearched by ſuch as worke in mines? It is a maruell that they are not alreadie come vnto the Antipodes, conſidering the deep pits, gulfes and holes whereinto they are deſcended.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Iob</hi> hauing ſpoken of gold and ſiluer, doth preſently make mention of the bounds of darknes and ſhadow of death. And in verie truth they are things which doe fitly agree with theſe two minerals: For they are hidden in verie obſcure and darke places, and couered with a verie thicke ſhadow: yet cannot this limit the couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and auarice of men, notwithſtanding that God hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admoniſhed them to moderate themſelues, ſeeing that he hath ſo hidden the gold and ſiluer, which prouoketh their aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, making them ſo furious and inſatiable. And therefore I might verie well compare them to bruite beaſts, yea to a flocke of ſheepe. For although that they daily behold by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences,<note place="margin">Men compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a flock of ſheepe.</note> the calamities which fall vpon the world through auarice, and eſpecially vpon thoſe, which are entangled with this vice, yet cannot one take example by another, but doe all followe one by one like poore brute beaſts and ſheepe, following one another when they are leade to that ſlaughter houſe, or when there is ſome one amongſt them that hath lead the way to the reſt, and hath made the firſt leape. For what daunger ſoeuer there bee, yea though it were to tumble headlong downewards, into ſome bottomeleſſe pit, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if one begin the daunce: for hee ſhall preſently haue good companie, yea ſuch, as there is not one of the whole troupe, but will luſtily ruſh after without thinking vpon any danger. Who doth not ſee that it is euen ſo in mans life? For according as ſome haue wickedly begun, others purſue them, and the latter cannot diſcouer their owne follie by that of the former, nor yet correct it by ſo many examples as they haue of euill ends, and pernicious euents, which haue willingly fallen vpon the couetous. For this cauſe the prophet hauing deſcribed the follie and preſumption of men, which thinke to build an eternity vnto themſelues with temporall riches; he addeth [Their way vttereth their fooliſhnes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.</note> yet their poſteritie delight in their talke: like ſheepe they lie in the graue: death deuoureth them.] See there the ſhepheard and the flock of the couetous, death, and the ſepulchre.</p>
                  <p>Now our meaning is not here to blame the vſe of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but onely the abuſe.<note place="margin">Of the right vſe of gold, and ſiluer.</note> For wee behold the great commodities
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:8737:226"/>
that men haue by communicating one with another, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie aiding one another in all that which is rare and exquiſite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and that by meanes of thoſe mettals and mony that is coined thereof. For ſo may they furniſh themſelues of all things neceſſary for their vſe, for their life, and according to their wiſh, not onely from one country to another, but (as wee may well ſay) from one end of the world to another. And if by their auarice they abuſe not this great commoditie, it wil bee much more profitable to all. But their vnſatiable couetouſnes of gaine is cauſe that the amiable communication, and the good deſire of one neighbor to profite another, which ſhould bee by meanes of gold and ſiluer, is conuerted oftentimes into plaine robberie. For their harts are ſo ſet on fire with loue of riches, that they propoſe no other determination vnto themſelues, ſaue to heape vp trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by a deceitfull meanes, which neuertheleſſe they doe neuer enioy in peace and content, beeing no more able to ſettle their couetouſnes, and aſſwage their appetite, then to quench a great fire with laying dry wood vpon it: but that it wil alwaies encreaſe and enflame the more. And to ſpeake truth, what is this gold and ſiluer, but a little yealow and white earth? And if there bee any difference, it is onely, in that the ſubſtance is more hardned: and what doe they differ therein from the baſeſt hard ſtones? It is onely in colour. Why then doe men trauaile and take great care to heap vp gold and ſiluer, rather then to heap vp duſt, earth, and ſtones? But indeede this is much worſe; for they heap vp an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy treaſure, when for earth and clay, they gaine vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the treaſure of the curſe of God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Abat.</hi> 2.</note> For it is written [Curſed be hee that heapeth vp that which is not his: how long will he lade himſelfe with thick clay.] But what? This clay ſo yealow and white, firme and exquiſite, doth dazzle their eies more then any thing elſe: and yet for all that, it is but earth. And therefore it is but opinion that cauſeth one thing to be eſteemed more then an other. For if men had giuen that value to other mettals, which they haue appointed to gold and ſiluer, there would be almoſt no difference of the one from the other. I ſay moreouer that if they had but equall regard to the vtilitie and nature of things, according to the profit which they receiue thereby, and the need which they haue therof, they ſhould more eſteeme of iron, braſſe and copper, then of gold and ſiluer: conſidering that by iron, the earth which nouriſheth vs is plowed, and arts and occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:8737:226"/>
mantained, and that by it we defend our ſelues from the furie of beaſts and enemies: and of tinne and copper we make the moſt principall vtenſils and tooles in our houſes to boyle our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals in, and for other infinite vſes. In all theſe things then wee acknowledge the folly and want of iudgement in men, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne themſelues more by opinion then by reaſon.</p>
                  <p>We may ſay as much concerning precious ſtones,<note place="margin">Of the vſe, and abuſe of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones.</note> which they haue eſteemed at a more high price then gold and ſiluer. For how many crownes doe they oftentimes giue for one pearle, or for a diamond, or for ſome other ſtone? If the fancie take them, and that they doe but onely like ſome ſmall precious ſtone, then doe they ſpare gold, and ſiluer no more then if they were duſt and clay: then that which they ſo much delight in, and for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which, they direct and gouerne their whole courſe of life; yea, and put it into all confuſion, is nothing with them in reſpect of a ſmall iewell. And what profit can redound vnto them by all this? Nothing elſe, but a vaine perſuaſion that induceth them to obtaine a ſtone of ſuch and ſuch woorth, as it pleaſeth them to eſteeme it at. If they would thinke as much of a flint, a flint would no leſſe content them. If it be for the beautie and colour that they ſo account of this merchandize: is there any thing fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, cleerer, or cleaner then glaſſe? nay then chryſtall? likewiſe the marble, alablaſter, iaſper, and ſuch like matters, do they giue much place in beautie or hardnes, to the moſt excellent precious ſtones? If for their vertues and properties in phiſicke they are ſo much reſpected; why then they ſhould buy nothing more deere, not eſteem of any thing more then of herbs and plants? I ſpeake not this to deſpiſe or condemne the vſe of precious ſtones, no more then of gold and ſiluer. For God did not create them, but for the ſeruice of man, and that he might pleaſe himſelfe with them, as with all his other creatures.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.26.27.28.</note> For it was his will that his temple and the veſſels therein, the garments of the high prieſt, and the ſeruice by him ordayned in the church of Iſraël, ſhould be adorned and enriched with gold, ſiluer, and with precious ſtones. Againe, <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and the other kings of Iſrael were neuer reprehended nor condemned becauſe they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in ſuch riches. We doe not then condemne the vſe, but the abuſe. For God requireth that his creatures may be vſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ordinance, and ſo moderated, that there be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, whereby he may be diſhonored &amp; offended, or our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:8737:227"/>
endomaged. But it is an hard matter to heape vp great ſtore of gold and ſiluer, and to diſpend ſo much vpon precious ſtones, and other the pomps of the world, but that great wrong muſt needs bee done to many perſons, or at leaſt wiſe that the deeds of charitie, for which we were borne, muſt needs waxe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſlacke.

for which we are borne, and endued with reaſon, let vs not thinke but that brute beaſts haue more whereof to brag in regard of the world, and of the beawtie and commoditie thereof, and that they receiue more reſt, pleaſure, and profite thereby then men. For they content themſelues with that which they haue, and care not for that, which they cannot attaine vnto: enioying all that which is needfull for them, and that with pleaſure, and without exceſſe, ſuperfluitie, or any hurt.

For this is the true doctrine, and the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, that euery one muſt, and may reape by the grace of God, of this totall worke in heauen, and in earth, to the end to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and to glorifie him.

                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 12.</note> who can turne him?] And ſtraight after [In his hand is the ſoule of euery liuing thing, and the breath of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.] On the other ſide, ſhall not we be induced to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto him, and to put our truſt in him, as in the Al-mightie, who can ſaue and defend thoſe, whom he will take into his cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and whom he will accept for his people, and for his ſeruants and children? Who ſo dwelleth in the ſecret of the moſt high (ſaith the prophet) ſhall abide in the ſhadow of the Al-mightie. I will ſay vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.</note> Oh mine hope and my fortreſſe: in my God will I truſt: who will deliuer vs out of all trouble. And to conclude, we ſhall haue goodly matter, whereby to giue him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and laude all the daies of our life, by ſeruing him according to his holy will. We ſhall be I ſay, verie blinde and ſenſeleſſe, if we do not humble our ſelues vnder the greatnes of the puiſſance of God: if we haue recourſe vnto, or put our confidence in any other, but in him alone: and if we do not acknowledge his great prouidence, wiſedome and bountie, which he hath vſed euer ſince the beginning towards vs, and the regard and care which he hath daily had of vs, and how that he entreateth vs ſo benign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo tenderly, and with ſuch fatherly affection, to the ende that

we may render thanks vnto him. For as we haue ſeene, before that he created man, he would prepare his lodging for him: the which he did adorne with all beautie, and with all riches, and did afterwards place him in this world, as in a moſt delectable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, &amp; made him Lord &amp; maſter ouer all his creatures, of whom he hath prouided him ſuch abundance, &amp; in ſuch variety, that it is impoſſible to comprehend theſe, or to deſire more. As it were then rauiſhed in the conſideration of ſo great bountie and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of God, let vs crie out with the prophet, [Oh Lord our God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.</note> how excellent is thy name in all the world! What is man that thou art mindfull of him, and the ſunne of man, that thou ſheweſt him ſo much grace as to viſite him, and to take care of him!] And ſo giuing glorie vnto his name, for ſo many benefits, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for that it hath pleaſed him to grant vs this grace, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to a deſired ende our Academicall diſcourſes, concerning his workes, in the Vniuers, let vs pronounce this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canticle of the Angels. Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Hoſtes, all the earth is full of thy glorie.</p>
